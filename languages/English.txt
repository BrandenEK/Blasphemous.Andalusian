BOSSES/DLG_BS102_01_0: Penitent One, free me from this false virtue. Free me from this false death.
BOSSES/DLG_BS102_02_0: Kissed by the Miracle or not, your penitence ends here.
BOSSES/DLG_BS102_03_0: Rest now alongside the broken reflection of my tomb.
BOSSES/DLG_BS102_04_0: Die and come back to me when our Miracle has returned you.
BOSSES/DLG_BS102_05_0: My passion, once made gold, now returns to my body.
BOSSES/DLG_BS102_06_0: The fatal bargain that governs my awakening has been struck - I must end thy irreverent intention, Penitent One.
BOSSES/DLG_BS102_06_1: And so the long night is severed. Dawn cometh.
BOSSES/DLG_BS12_01_0: Sister... Forgive me...
BOSSES/DLG_BS12_01_1: Now I will cross over to the other side of the Dream and return to your side...
BOSSES/DLG_BS12_02_0: Sister, I know you are there, even if I can't see you. Hear my plea.
BOSSES/DLG_BS12_02_1: After your departure, it is now my turn to prove I'm deserving of our captain's trust. I will not fail Crisanta.
BOSSES/DLG_BS12_02_2: And may the greatest of pains devour me if I let the penitence through this door.
BOSSES/DLG_BS12_02_3: On your guard, Penitent One.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_01_0: Here we are, my crimson figure and you, on this side of the Dream.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_01_1: The Miracle has turned me into a sentinel of its sacred home. This is my new calling.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_01_2: What do you hope to find here that is not the blinding grey light that tempers our wounds, and the vast horizons that extend without end?
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_01_3: The path of paths has ended and, with it, so too has your penance.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_02_0: There is no point in recoiling from the desires of the all-knowing and all-powerful Miracle.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_03_0: Bleed, for only spilt blood brings us closer to true Sanctity.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_04_0: What is this cold that is born of my entrails? Is this the death of the soul, the mind, the being?
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_05_0: My final task is completed.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_05_1: I will go and so too will all those who loved me.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_05_2: Now I will sink down here in this land of clouds, in this realm of dust and glimmering lights.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_06_0: Now let your body, like mine, be bathed in blood.
BOSSES/DLG_BS203_06_1: This will be your final resting place, but no one here will be able to watch over you.

CUTSCENE/CTS04-Dagger_Lady_0: Blessed are the eyes that with devotion see my tormented heart.
CUTSCENE/CTS04-Dagger_Lady_1: Let the ones who are joyful in affliction and fasting come to me, for they are pleasant penance.
CUTSCENE/CTS04-Dagger_Lady_2: Six stinging pains lance my flowery breast: take the first one and purge one of your six mortal stains of the soul.
CUTSCENE/CTS07-Deosgracias_0: The Cradle of Affliction is what you seek.
CUTSCENE/CTS07-Deosgracias_1: This can be found in the Mother of Mothers of the churches.
CUTSCENE/CTS09-EndingB_0: The mountain of ashes that swallowed up sins and sinners alike has had no mercy on you either.
CUTSCENE/CTS09-EndingB_1: At the mercy of the Miracle you were and at the mercy of the Miracle you remain.
CUTSCENE/CTS09-EndingB_2: You are no longer anything but one more anonymous visage, without a voice, without a countenance.
CUTSCENE/CTS09-EndingB_3: Your penitence is over.
CUTSCENE/CTS102-Santos1_0: The Five guarded the Twisted One whenever he was paraded in public, when he still lived in that divine prison of pain and piety, supported on and rooted in a tree, between sobs and cracks.
CUTSCENE/CTS102-Santos1_1: It was long ago... Yes, long ago...
CUTSCENE/CTS102-Santos1_2: From them arose the Saeta, the procession march that spread far and wide letting all know that The Father was being swayed again.
CUTSCENE/CTS103-Santos2_0: The passion of Laudes, the first Amanecida, was immense. Such was her devotion to the Twisted One that her body was unable to bear it.
CUTSCENE/CTS103-Santos2_1: One night, she felt the pores of her skin open, and her very passion began to exit through them, taking the form of liquid gold.
CUTSCENE/CTS103-Santos2_2: In that long night, that fine thread was woven by the High Will, creating the bodies of the other four women. They are nothing but the very passion of Laudes incarnate.
CUTSCENE/CTS106-LaudesIntro_0: Oh, Saeta. Where once its piercing song shattered the mirrors and trinkets in my tomb, let its wail now grant light. Saeta, awakener of the desolate, ignite these five lifeless eyes!
CUTSCENE/CTS106-LaudesIntro_1: These millennia of torment, my punishment, thread through my bones like poison. My forbidden passion is my penance. My golden virtuous strength armours me. I let this happen - I let this ardour grow inside me.
CUTSCENE/CTS106-LaudesIntro_2: But only The Miracle giveth. Only The Miracle taketh away.
CUTSCENE/IntroBrotherhood_0: Because it is my Guilt, I claim you, Grievous Miracle.
CUTSCENE/IntroBrotherhood_1: Make my chest hurt with regret.
CUTSCENE/IntroBrotherhood_2: Forge your punishment and nail it deep.
CUTSCENE/IntroBrotherhood_3: Shape my Guilt, once again.
CUTSCENE/IntroDeosgracias_0: And thus, guilt, repentance, mourning and every pain of the soul of all kind were visibly and tangibly manifested, everywhere and in all of us.
CUTSCENE/IntroDeosgracias_1: Sometimes in the form of blessing and grace, sometimes in the form of punishment and corruption.
CUTSCENE/IntroDeosgracias_2: That divine will, equally pious and cruel, which we could not and will never be able to unravel, was called The Miracle.
CUTSCENE/MeaCulpa_0: Penitent one, you who carry the painful guilt in your cracked hands...
CUTSCENE/MeaCulpa_1: lend it to us and alleviate our burden.
CUTSCENE/MeaCulpa_2: Lend it to us and wipe away our tears.
CUTSCENE/MeaCulpa_3: Because it is an act of penitence.
CUTSCENE/PontiffEvent1_0: There is no answer to our plea, the Miracle has forsaken us, and my ornate throne turns its back on those who await here.
CUTSCENE/PontiffEvent2_0: I feel my blood turning into black sap, and my aged skin into reddish bark.
CUTSCENE/PontiffEvent3_0: I see everything from the highest point of the dried tree in which the Miracle has reincarnated me.
CUTSCENE/PontiffEvent4_0: I burn from the inside out, and my smoke is a fog that conceals everything.
CUTSCENE/PontiffEvent5_0: I awake now, from the silver ash that had been my cradle. The Miracle calls me.
CollectibleItem/CO01_CAPTION: Parietal bone of Lasser, the Inquisitor

CollectibleItem/CO10_CAPTION: Ulna of Koke, the Troubadour

CollectibleItem/CO27_CAPTION: Phalanx of William, the Sceptic

CollectibleItem/CO29_CAPTION: Occipital of Tequila, the Metalsmith

CollectibleItem/CO30_CAPTION: Maxilla of Tarradax, the Cleric
CollectibleItem/CO30_DESCRIPTION: With his broad smile and good manners, Nicodemus Tarradax never denied anyone refuge in his church. The discovery of a pile of bones in the sacristy revealed his true intentions.
CollectibleItem/CO31_CAPTION: Nasal bone of Charles, the Artist
CollectibleItem/CO31_DESCRIPTION: The beauty of his work sparked a strong debate within the church. It was commanded that no representation could be more beautiful than life itself. Dryden's collection was confiscated, and he was forgotten.
CollectibleItem/CO32_CAPTION: Hyoid bone of Senex, the Beggar

CollectibleItem/CO33_CAPTION: Vertebra of Lindquist, the Forger

CollectibleItem/CO40_CAPTION: Lunate of Keiya, the Butcher
CollectibleItem/CO40_DESCRIPTION: His nickname "the Butcher" was owed not to his occupation, but to his vicious combat skills as a soldier. Not even corruption seemed to alter his disturbed personality.
CollectibleItem/CO41_CAPTION: Scaphoid of Fierce, the Leper
CollectibleItem/CO41_DESCRIPTION: Rejected by his family, his village and even by other lepers, Fierce only found solace in the echo that his voice returned to him when he took refuge in the tunnels of the Desecrated Cistern.
CollectibleItem/CO42_CAPTION: Anklebone of Weston, the Pilgrim
CollectibleItem/CO42_DESCRIPTION: His travelling companion assured him that he would wait for him at the next shelter, just a day away. When Weston arrived the next day, there was no one there. Nor the day after that.
CollectibleItem/CO43_CAPTION: Calcaneum of Persian, the Bandit

Prayer/PR12_CAPTION: Cante Jondo of the Three Sisters

QuestItem/QI02_CAPTION: Mark of the First Refuge
QuestItem/QI02_DESCRIPTION: Sign of protection that freed its bearer from pain. The wounds appeared in the flesh of their lady, who once swore to suffer instead of her wards.
QuestItem/QI02_LORE: Socorro spent her childhood in a village which lined a route that Church prisoners, condemned for their crimes and sins, frequently traversed. From the window of her room, she could see how these prisoners climbed a hill in a line so that, when they reached the summit, they would be ready for the punishments and physical tortures reserved for them until they died.
QuestItem/QI03_CAPTION: Mark of the Second Refuge
QuestItem/QI03_DESCRIPTION: Sign of protection that protected its bearer from all harm. The Pious Lady of the Perpetual Agony locked herself in the great cathedral, its walls a lightweight barrier compared to the constant pain that clouded her mind.
QuestItem/QI03_LORE: Hearing the distant cries of the damned day and night turned Socorro into such a compassionate person that she devoted all her time to praying for those punished. So much did she pray for them to be freed from their pain and suffering that she dared ask the Miracle that the physical pain they were suffering be passed on to her.
QuestItem/QI04_CAPTION: Mark of the Third Refuge
QuestItem/QI04_DESCRIPTION: Sign of protection that prevented the suffering of its bearer. The Grievous Lady was wrapped in crimson mantles, a symbol of her link to the flesh of her wards.
QuestItem/QI04_LORE: As the legend goes, the wounds of lashes, cuts and blows received by the condemned began to appear on Socorro's body, and still she prayed for them, despite all that pain transferred to her, thus freeing the condemned from their suffering. So many injuries and so much pain were transferred to her that her body began deforming and drowning completely in wounds and bleeding bruises, but without causing her death. Her cries were so deafening that news of this miraculous event soon spread around the land.
QuestItem/QI06_CAPTION: Tentudía's Carnal Remains
QuestItem/QI06_DESCRIPTION: Remains of the murdered novice Tentudía that were isolated from the rest so she could not receive a holy burial.
QuestItem/QI06_LORE: "Who was Tentudía, you ask? Well, she was once a girl born in this same yellowish village of Albero, like you and me. On her fifteenth year, something extremely unusual happened. Her parents watched as part of her hair began twisting, unavoidably turning into very thin thorns. Concerned with the thought that it might be a punishment from the Miracle, they locked her in as a novice inside a distant nunnery, famous for its strict cloistering, thus preventing the discovery of what would have, undoubtedly, been considered heresy."
QuestItem/QI07_CAPTION: Remains of Tentudía's Hair
QuestItem/QI07_DESCRIPTION: Remain of the thorned hairs of the novice Tentudía that were isolated from the rest so she could not receive a holy burial.
QuestItem/QI07_LORE: "Tentudía spent several years in that nunnery, and as she grew up, it became harder and harder to hide her hair: it wouldn't stop twisting and growing thorns, and the blood from the wounds it caused her did not take long to stain her pure white habit. The nuns, upon realising, were frightened by it and soon began considering her cursed, and a heretic, just as the parents of the girl had feared would happen."
QuestItem/QI08_CAPTION: Tentudía's Skeletal Remains
QuestItem/QI08_DESCRIPTION: Remains of the novice Tentudía that were isolated from the rest so she could not receive a holy burial.
QuestItem/QI08_LORE: "The nuns planned her execution in utmost secrecy, even without a trial or a report to the church, in fear it would reach the ears of the implacable inquisitors of the Miracle. So, after her condemnation, they did not give her the proper burial worthy of the sisters of the nunnery, but instead buried the remains of her body scattered around the vicinity, because it is known that if one's body is not whole in the burial, the soul will not cross through the Dream."

QuestItem/QI101_DESCRIPTION: A sphere of liquid silver touched by the Miracle. Brought to Cvstodia by alchemists from distant lands, back when the roads were still open and the wagons left furrows in the mud. In the right hands, its latent healing powers could be revived, but alas, the art of alchemy was lost many eons ago.
QuestItem/QI101_LORE: It emerges from the pores of the earth. From between the flagstones. It is the silver of the ornaments, desperate to flee, to escape from them and turn from their sanctity.

Its stem bends when no one looks at it, pointing towards the Forest of the Holy Line.@The stone petals are signs of the Sorrowful Miracle, warnings that something sleeping must wake.
QuestItem/QI106_LORE: Why have you chosen me? Why do I feel you in my flesh, in my skin, in my blood? Punishment, say at least one word so I can understand why you keep me prisoner between sleep and wakefulness. May my body break for you. My arms be bound for you. My eyes awaken when you call me by name. Confine me to the stone room and let the stone itself be the key that sets me free.

QuestItem/QI13_CAPTION: Egg of Deformity
QuestItem/QI13_DESCRIPTION: Hirsute egg, born of abomination. Its hairy shell hides unfathomable mysteries from prying eyes. The cruelty of a broken promise shaped Altasgracias, and the Affliction made her sorrows into flesh.
QuestItem/QI13_LORE: We will enclose our voices inside this egg, our tongues that endlessly twist and grow in order to escape. Knots of a freedom we never had. Our hair will cover this ovum with cold until the heat of embers makes it hatch.

Part 5@@"Congregation members, witnesses to the phenomenon, watched in astonishment and fear, except for one of our sisters, who knelt beside me, and, without fear of contagion, kissed one of the terrible sores that the affection had caused on the young man, and the wound began to close. The brothers fell to their knees, amidst tears and prayers."
QuestItem/QI201_CAPTION: Severed Right Eye of the Traitor
QuestItem/QI201_DESCRIPTION: An eyeball of solid gold that adorned the scythe of Isidora, the singer of the dead. Condemned to an eternity of deep-rooted darkness, the melted face of the Traitor was also robbed of his eyes for he had seen too much. The lady of the ossuary was charged to watch over him, and the bones that used to sing with her found a new tomb in the darkest of corners.
QuestItem/QI201_LORE: The children opened the doors of their houses and ran out after her shouting, “Isidora! Sing to us, Isidora!” But, still dressed in one of her flamboyant stage outfits, Isidora did not sing to them that night.@Instead she headed towards the cemetery and stopped before the entrance to the crypt that connects to the ossuary beneath the old Church of Albero. The intrigued children fell silent behind the iron gates. And it was then that she began to intone verses that no one had ever heard before. After a short while, another distant voice could be heard, accompanying the sad melody from the depths of the crypt, forming a beautiful yet mournful duet. The lady then walked through the stone archway, closing the door behind her. As her voice faded into the distance, more and more voices joined with her, as if a great choir of dozens was awaiting her at the bottom of the steps. When the song came to an end and they heard the final strains rise up from beneath the ground, the children walked away with tears in their eyes, and the cemetery recovered its usual silence.@Never again was the singing lady seen, and ever since she has been remembered as Isidora, the Lady of the Ossuary and the voice of the dead.
QuestItem/QI202_CAPTION: Broken Left Eye of the Traitor
QuestItem/QI202_DESCRIPTION: Eyeball forged in gold, torn from the socket of a beast from the depths. The Traitor was banished to this world, condemned to remember the truth he had dared to gaze upon. One of the eyes was delivered to the sea and no more was heard of it, but the waters that engulfed it became the burial ground of any vessel that ventured to sail through them.
QuestItem/QI202_LORE: “A curse on you. A curse on your shadow beneath the dark waters that writhes around knotted in strange hieroglyphics. A curse on your white scales that reflect the pale light of our moons. A curse on the jewels that adorn your shapeless necks. And a curse on the Eye, your golden eye that beckons to men and storms to die before you.”
QuestItem/QI203_CAPTION: Incomplete Scapular
QuestItem/QI203_DESCRIPTION: Half of a scapular, with an effigy of the Twisted One that hangs at the end of a fine crimson cord. These words, almost worn away by the repeated caresses of zealous fingers, are carved into the polished wood.@"Even at a distance we are together, always. @Esdras."
QuestItem/QI203_LORE: "The battle is over at last, brother. Do not concern yourself with my wounds... When my eyes close, the Miracle will take me with the Father. Here, this is half of my scapular. Remember that if you manage to reunite the two halves, it will be because I wished it so. @My brother, dry your tears. Although I must go, my voice will be yours forever."
QuestItem/QI204_CAPTION: Key Grown from Twisted Wood
QuestItem/QI204_DESCRIPTION: A ponderous key, grown straight from the trunk of a tree. Its surface is polished like an impossible carving, except for three striking knots that serve as teeth. A layer of molten gold covers its head, the only show of deference to the Traitor who was locked up in the deepest roots of Cvstodia.
QuestItem/QI204_LORE: Diosdado observed that singular wooden key in a silence disturbed only by the rattle of his own breathing. After a long pause he finally said, “No, there is no other key like this.” Then he began to walk, leaning on the lamp that he used as a stick, and looking around anxiously, trying to find something that would help him remember the place where the strange door could be found, in whose lock this unusual key would fit. He walked down long hallways, crammed with dusty tomes, past bookcases filled with ramshackle wooden shelves that had long ago rotted in the humid air, when suddenly he heard a grinding sound: the key of knotted wood was stirring in the palm of his hand and seemed to be twisting more and more. It was then that he realised he had found the door he was looking for.
QuestItem/QI20_CAPTION: Incense Garlic
QuestItem/QI20_DESCRIPTION: Bulb white as bone, very hard to find. Its intense aroma, reminiscent of sandalwood, is only noticeable on rainy days, betraying its hiding place. It was sought after by the herbalists with the best sense of smell for its miraculous properties.
QuestItem/QI20_LORE: Confessions of Tirso. Part 6@@"Ever since then, our pious kisses have saved hundreds from the affection of the Miracle that ravages these lands, and from then on our congregation has been called that of the Kissers of Wounds."

QuestItem/QI301_LORE: Holy Creed. Forbidden Verse@@“It is only the Fourth Wound that, unlike its sisters, makes the soul suffer in such a way that goes beyond repentance as an act and beyond guilt as a perpetual state. It is only the Fourth that represents the deepest and most forbidden pain. The greatest and truest wound of the lost soul. The wounds of eventide.”

QuestItem/QI60_LORE: Confession of Orestes@@My forces are decreasing. I fear that the sacred mission that your Most Illustrious has entrusted to me is beyond our abilities. The others are mistaken: if the answer were so easily found, I would not have ventured into this place, crossing the boundaries of the flesh. My time, limited as it already was, has not been enough to unravel the unfathomable mysteries of this dream kingdom. This land that my ignorance and pride have turned into my grave.@@I find consolation in knowing that the mask will remain with me, thus eluding ungodly hands in the same way that the answers I sought have managed to elude my useless scrutiny.

QuestItem/QI61_LORE: Confessions from Dolphos. Part 1@@They don't understand. They will not find Grace amid old books and dark dreams. Grace is in purity itself, in what we can see and touch.

QuestItem/QI62_DESCRIPTION: Artefact found in the hands of a dead archdeacon in a dusty library.
QuestItem/QI62_LORE: Confessions from Crescente@@The ravages of time had taken their toll on the mind of the one I once respected like a father. He has allowed himself to be carried away by the superstition and fallacies of the village, searching for the impossible with his clouded eyes among the altars of the Mother. And Dolphos betrays the trust of his Most Illustrious, taking refuge in the cold peaks with his host of servants, wearing his introspection as an excuse to hide his laziness and lack of faith. Only I, the only one capable of ascending to the marble halls with an adequate response, remain. The forbidden volumes of these endless shelves will not resist the zeal of my searching much longer.
QuestItem/QI63_CAPTION: Dried Clove
QuestItem/QI63_DESCRIPTION: Rare and fragrant spice, coming from distant lands. Trading caravans stopped traversing these stony roads long ago, making this item a rare discovery. In the past it was highly prized for its strength in poultices and balms.
QuestItem/QI63_LORE: It was not just hearsay anymore: the illness had reached Albero without warning. The outbreak and punishment of the Miracle, so often discussed, came through a young man who arrived to our small congregation full of fear, wondering what his unforgivable sin had been to receive such a condemnation.
QuestItem/QI64_CAPTION: Sooty Garlic

QuestItem/QI64_LORE: "And what could we do, a crowd of plain and profane healers, blind to the vague wills of the Miracle? Pray, begging for its forgiveness?

We brothers of the congregation were unable to cope, and our care was not working, nor were our ointments, nor our constant prayers. We are lost, submerged in the darkness of uncertainty.
QuestItem/QI66_CAPTION: Linen Cloth
QuestItem/QI66_DESCRIPTION: A useless rag that seems to slightly vibrate at times, emitting an unintelligible buzz. The Affliction sometimes leaves its mark on mundane-looking objects, unable to reveal the miracle under its mantle of corruption.
QuestItem/QI66_LORE: Febrile as he was, he hardly noticed that someone had sat down next to him. A gentle hand patted a white cloth on his forehead; it was a fabric of the utmost softness, which allowed light through it as if it were a sheet of paper, and was soaking his feverish sweats and providing such relief that he could not help but fall asleep. When the cloth was soaked, the nun got up and handed it to the Mother Superior, adding: "With this, we will be able to have his confession."
QuestItem/QI67_CAPTION: Severed Hand
QuestItem/QI67_DESCRIPTION: A severed hand that tightly grasps a broken bell, sometimes afflicted by slight spasms. The Affliction sometimes leaves its mark on mundane-looking objects, unable to reveal the miracle under its mantle of corruption.
QuestItem/QI67_LORE: "... As soon as the atrocious earth tremor was heard, they knew something dreadful had happened. They searched for their master in the deepest parts of the cave, where they were met with a gigantic dust cloud that extended far beyond their eyes, and even though they called the name of their master, there were no answers. Days went by until the cloud cleared and they could face the devastating consequences of the landslide, feeling hopeless, but suddenly, amidst their tears, they heard a faraway sound..."
QuestItem/QI68_CAPTION: Dried Flowers bathed in Tears
QuestItem/QI68_DESCRIPTION: Olive tree petals, vitrified by frost. Tears of true bitterness prevented the cold from withering them completely. Now they are an offering never made, lost in the snow before it could reach the sepulchre of the saint.
QuestItem/QI68_LORE: Well, I remember it with great sorrow. Engracia was one of us, born in Albero like you and me. She was peculiar, however, because every day, after a day gathering olives, she stayed in the mountains while the rest of us left. Some said they had seen her cry, and that's why we thought she stayed among the olive trees, to be alone with her sorrow. Many years of drought razed the land back then, but although the other crops dried up and died, the olive trees on our hill would not: they remained the best harvests, to everyone's surprise. This gave rise to the rumour that the olive trees were being watered by the girl's very tears. One morning, we found the girl dead, leaning on one of the olive trees; whether she died of sorrow we will never know. We buried her in a small cave next to the olive trees where she cried. The next day, the olive trees had withered.
QuestItem/QI69_CAPTION: Key of the Secular
QuestItem/QI69_DESCRIPTION: Small, simple key. The Initiates visited only the minor prisoners, bringing them food on the rare occasions when the inmate's life had to be preserved.
QuestItem/QI69_LORE: "... He took a large stone that rested nearby and struck his leg with it until his bones broke, thus escaping from the chain that held him prisoner. Crawling, he left the place, but the sand under his feet, according to what he told us, absorbed the trail of blood he left behind, and so his captors could not tell which path he had taken. Since then, every night, he prays, tearfully, next to a pile of sand he keeps beside his bed..."
QuestItem/QI70_CAPTION: Key of the Scribe
QuestItem/QI70_DESCRIPTION: Iron key, well preserved. The Scribes were present at each interrogation, tasked with recording the inevitable confessions of the tortured.
QuestItem/QI70_LORE: Father, take off these things that restrain my arms and legs...

For what other reasons could there be behind this miraculous talent? My sin has been overlooking the merit of such a valuable gift."@@The inquisitor sitting in the centre of the room answered: "What gesture could then be more pious than using your grace in benefit of the Church, Holy and Wise?" Then he got up from his throne and, hoisting a lustrous silver tray bearing precious ornaments, said: " May your fortunate eyes rest here henceforth, and a windowless chapel be their dwelling. For this is the Word of our Holy Mother Church."
QuestItem/QI72_CAPTION: Key of the High Peaks
QuestItem/QI72_DESCRIPTION: Key for the transportation that leads to the remote convent.
QuestItem/QI72_LORE: The key must be silver, but not any kind. I want it to be the purest there is. Bring it to me when its beauty is as high as its task is meaningful. The chariot will be sealed and forbidden, and your horses will sleep for as long as I order it. This I command, and my command is the command of His Holiness Himself.

I have written about our church, our saints and our Miracle of the Greatest Pain. I must inform you that I have made the decision to leave, although I intend to continue writing. In these walls I cannot be a true witness of the works of the Miracle. I need to appreciate with my own eyes your holy works. I will be a teller of the Miracle wherever it takes me, rain or shine, or scorching sand under my bare feet."
Relic/RE01_CAPTION: Blood Perpetuated in Sand
Relic/RE01_DESCRIPTION: Preserved blood with miraculous properties. With the passage of its bearer, new ledges are revealed, formerly invisible to the beholder's eyes.@The Miracle is truly unfathomable, and no one knows the origin of the blood that swirls around the wearer's feet.
Relic/RE01_LORE: "Take this bag and fill it with sand. Now imbue it with the blood spilling from these dreadful wounds, so it will turn crimson red. With it you will show the way through these dry lands to those who are yet to follow. Leave me, now. I want to say my prayers, for I will soon be joining the dry sap of these roots that painfully embrace Our Father..."
Relic/RE02_CAPTION: Incorrupt Hand of the Fraternal Master
Relic/RE02_DESCRIPTION: Sacred relic, in a perfect state of conservation. The hand shakes gently when it considers it necessary, secretly articulated by ethereal muscles and tendons. The bell that it's holding warns the wearer of the nearby presence of a mystery. @After all, no bastion is safe from the tenacity of the truly curious.
Relic/RE02_LORE: "... As soon as the atrocious earth tremor was heard, they knew something dreadful had happened. They searched for their master in the deepest parts of the cave, where they were met with a gigantic dust cloud that extended far beyond their eyes, and even though they called the name of their master, there were no answers. Days went by until the cloud cleared and they could face the devastating consequences of the landslide, feeling hopeless, but suddenly, amidst their tears, they heard a faraway sound."
Relic/RE03_CAPTION: Nail Uprooted from Dirt
Relic/RE03_DESCRIPTION: Incorrupt remains of the Great Pilgrim, founder of the order and comfort to his followers. His feet never stopped, always taking him forward in his mysterious wandering through Cvstodia. The bearer of this relic receives his determination, and walks effortlessly through swamps and muddy marshlands. 
Relic/RE03_LORE: "... And that fingernail was the one that Martyr Nicanor ripped from himself when he was buried alive between spasms of pain after a cruel torture in front of his followers who cried in silence. The fingernail barely visible among the removed dirt was picked up by the last follower, who was lamenting such a horrid event when all the others left and whose name is unknown. He wrapped it using a piece of cloth torn from his own clothes, and that same night, he went to the church whose congregation was the same one that had denounced Nicanor as a heretic, hid the fingernail among its inner bricks, and left..."
Relic/RE04_CAPTION: Shroud of Dreamt Sins
Relic/RE04_DESCRIPTION: Yellowish fabric, witness to febrile confessions. It still quivers in the face of tortured souls, allowing one to listen to those who can no longer speak.
Relic/RE04_LORE: Febrile as he was, he hardly noticed someone had sat down next to him. A gentle hand patted a white cloth on his forehead; it was a fabric of the utmost softness, which allowed light through it as if it were a sheet of paper, and was soaking his feverish sweat and providing such relief that he couldn't help but fall asleep. When the cloth was soaked, the nun got up and handed it to the Mother Superior, adding: "With this, we'll be able to have his confession."
Relic/RE05_CAPTION: Linen of Golden Thread
Relic/RE05_DESCRIPTION: Product of a spinning wheel that only turned on full moon nights, this thin thread was plaited to immortalise its progeny. Bestowed as a gift by the first-born, it allows The Penitent One to descend into bottomless abysses. 
Relic/RE05_LORE: Members of The Mother came and took the painting away as soon as I told them it was finished. They didn't say a word, they just covered it up and carried it away. I have been painting for The Mother all my life, recreating moments of the lives of the saints, but for this last canvas... it was as if they didn't want anyone laying eyes on it; they did not even let me, its creator, see it on display, if they ever came to display it. It was the last commission they requested from me.
Relic/RE07_CAPTION: Silvered Lung of Dolphos
Relic/RE07_DESCRIPTION: Organ preserved in sparkling silver, with plenty of filigrees. Cardinal Dolphos melted his spoons in a pot, looking to escape jealousies with the argentine concoction. Protects the wearer from poisonous Miasma.
Relic/RE07_LORE: Confessions from Dolphos. Part 3@@What's the use of gowns. What good is the gold from rings. Only the purity of silver that once was embellished possesses the graces of Miracle. Silver should not be seen, it should not be worn on the outside of the body, but on the inside: let it embellish the flesh, let it adorn the skin.
Relic/RE10_CAPTION: Three Gnarled Tongues
Relic/RE10_DESCRIPTION: Tied together by a broken oath, these tongues speak words that only the foundations of Cvstodia can hear. Their pleas awaken the sleeping roots from their lethargy, creating footbridges and climbable ledges for their wearers.
Relic/RE10_LORE: These are the three tongues born from the monstrosity. Three tongues that are three voices. Three cries in harmony. The tongues are knotted into one. Roots grow and twist in their presence, just like the hair of what were once three sisters.
RosaryBead/RB01_CAPTION: Dove Skull
RosaryBead/RB01_DESCRIPTION: Skull of a bird, drilled as a collet. Its apparent frailness slightly strengthens The Penitent One's defences.
RosaryBead/RB01_LORE: That morning, when the bonfires were lit and the convicts were raising their ghastly pleas to the indifferent inquisitors, a white dove came down from heaven and perched on the shoulder of a prisoner, where it stayed until it burned with him.
RosaryBead/RB02_CAPTION: Ember of the Holy Cremation.
RosaryBead/RB02_DESCRIPTION: Ember crystallised through a long forgotten ritual. It retains some of the heat of a bonfire lit on a different land. Tempers the heart, increasing the defences of whoever carries it.
RosaryBead/RB02_LORE: And so the March was sung, as a small group of parishioners walked in procession to the graveyard. The prayer was repeated over and over again along the way, turning their voices into a hypnotic whisper, murmurous and unrhythmic. Upon arrival at the burial ground, everything fell silent. When, with each shovelful from the undertakers,  the soil dropped cold onto the coffin, a hooded girl, rumoured to be the daughter of the deceased, threw in a hot ember that gleamed on its way down into the pit. The dirt continued to cover the hole but, to everyone's astonishment, the ember could still be seen, glowing under the frosty soil.
RosaryBead/RB03_CAPTION: Silver Grape
RosaryBead/RB03_DESCRIPTION: A dead fruit converted into a bead, in a display of clerical vanity. Its cold hardness passes onto its wearer, enhancing their defences considerably.
RosaryBead/RB03_LORE: Confessions from Dolphos. Part 2@@I must melt more beads, as many beads as I can. I need their silver, I need their embellished floral curves. The virtue of silver will adorn my lungs inside and out, and when I breathe, the pure grace of Miracle will penetrate. It will embellish my stomach inside and out, and when I eat, I will be nourished with the pure grace of the Miracle. It will ornament my eyes inside and out, and when I look, I will see the Miracle itself.
RosaryBead/RB04_CAPTION: Uvula of Proclamation
RosaryBead/RB04_DESCRIPTION: When the Uvula is equipped, you have a chance of earning Tears of Atonement when destroying an object.
RosaryBead/RB04_LORE: Decree from His Holiness Escribar@@"It shall be called the Anointed Legion" said His Holiness. "Under the armour, their bodies shall be covered with bandages anointed with oils that I myself will bless. They will protect the Mother of Mothers as I will protect them."
RosaryBead/RB05_CAPTION: Hollow Pearl
RosaryBead/RB05_DESCRIPTION: Empty, tarnished sphere. There is no trace of nacre left, but it retains just a hint of bluish sheen. It creates fervour when destroying surrounding objects.
RosaryBead/RB05_LORE: "It has got to him, brother, the Miracle is within these walls," said the friar, scared.@"Grab that piece of wood and help me block his cell," answered the other friar, younger than him.@And, while they both parted slowly, listening to the screams and banging through the massive wooden door, a small, round object rolled from under it.
RosaryBead/RB06_CAPTION: Knot of Hair
RosaryBead/RB06_DESCRIPTION: Tangle of hair knotted with the strength of three broken bonds. A strong knot allows it to be used as a rosary bead, carrying part of its unyielding strength to the wearer.
RosaryBead/RB06_LORE: No. 4 All those who had come to the sacred link knelt in the presence of that fruit of the Miracle, thus making it an object of worship from that moment on. We built an altar worthy of such holiness and placed it there. Shortly afterwards, during one bleak night, the priests who slept inside the church heard a loud groan, a cry made of three voices, yet one voice at the same time. When we got there, the egg was gone. Ever since then, I have been looking for it, visiting all the places I could and talking to every soul I could.
RosaryBead/RB07_CAPTION: Painted Wood Bead
RosaryBead/RB07_DESCRIPTION: Sphere covered in yellow varnish. The chipped paint betrays its origin: holm oak of the Forest of the Holy Line. It recovers health when destroying surrounding objects.
RosaryBead/RB07_LORE: We call this pilgrimage route The Trail. Our wagons have always passed through here, and the tracks have gotten deep enough to even unearth the chalky sand that lay hidden under the thick forest, such that if one could see it from above, it would look like a long ochre line crossing the woods.
RosaryBead/RB08_CAPTION: Piece of a Golden Mask
RosaryBead/RB08_DESCRIPTION: Piece of embossed gold, part of a mask broken years ago. The nuns of the Convent of the Charred Visage swear never to let the world see their burned faces, and the conviction of its old wearer has permeated the metal. Grants some protection against flames.
RosaryBead/RB08_LORE: No. 2 The years passed and she started showing natural signs of ageing, just like her companions, except for the burn, which remained as fresh as the moment the boiling oil had spilled. The wound was still smoking, scorching and reeking. This was understood to be a miracle, and she was canonised in life by the Church; she became known as Our Lady of the Charred Visage. An order was founded in her name, where all the existing nuns as well as those who wanted to take up the habit had to burn their faces in the same way as Áurea had. She wears a golden mask under which she hides the gauze that alleviates the eternal pain that the burns still inflict on her.
RosaryBead/RB09_CAPTION: Moss Preserved in Glass
RosaryBead/RB09_DESCRIPTION: Minute jar filled with moss. The tiny white flowers that shimmer inside can grant some protection against toxins.
RosaryBead/RB09_LORE: The ashen grey air lashed us. We could hardly breathe, and remained locked up in the parish, placing damp cloths on the doors and windows. We were suffocating. Then, one fateful night, there was a knock on the door, and I could see a woman who, without a word, had placed on the floor a cloth with patches of pearly moss on it. I stared at her in disbelief, as she appeared to have smeared the moss on her nostrils. Then, turning around, the woman left. Hopeful, I recounted what I had witnessed to the brothers, and we decided to spread the substance on our noses as she had done. It wasn't long before we were able to breathe normally, and we waited without fear until the ashy, leaden sky would regain its blue colour.
RosaryBead/RB101_CAPTION: Reliquary of the Fervent Heart
RosaryBead/RB101_DESCRIPTION: It retains in its bosom the mark of a fulfilled penance. It inflames the heart of its bearer with burning faith, granting automatic regeneration of Fervour.
RosaryBead/RB101_LORE: To obtain forgiveness for the sin committed, the repentant must cover his face with the iron mask, because sin may have no identity, no owner, no voice. Only the sin itself is what differentiates us in the eyes of the Father. The penitential mask is the first step on the ladder to reconciliation with the Father.
RosaryBead/RB102_CAPTION: Reliquary of the Suffering Heart
RosaryBead/RB102_DESCRIPTION: It retains in its bosom the mark of a fulfilled penance. It lacerates the heart of its wearer with pain that he has not yet suffered, making the Bile Flasks heal its wearer for a while, while he is out of danger.
RosaryBead/RB102_LORE: To obtain forgiveness for the sin committed, the repentant must cleanse his soul with sanctifying grace through the suffering of his heart. Only this pain of repentance is capable of eliciting the purifying grace that reconciles the sinner to the Father. Only sincere sorrow paves the way.
RosaryBead/RB103_CAPTION: Reliquary of the Sorrowful Heart
RosaryBead/RB103_DESCRIPTION: It retains in its bosom the mark of a fulfilled penance. It burdens the heart of its bearer with True Guilt, turning the Bile Flasks into receptacles of pure liquid Fervour.
RosaryBead/RB103_LORE: To obtain forgiveness for the sin committed, the repentant must choose his penance and carry it along the Path of Blame until the final reconciliation with the Father. Each Path of Blame is unique and belongs only to the penitent who chooses and follows it. It will remain marked in his memory as scars on his own body, in the face of a great wound. Only in this way will he obtain victory over sin.
RosaryBead/RB104_CAPTION: Token of Appreciation
RosaryBead/RB104_DESCRIPTION: Just an ordinary marble, presented as thanks for the charity received. Somehow, the scratched glass resonates with the empty Bile Flasks, increasing your strength when their liquid has run out.
RosaryBead/RB104_LORE: Finally, the church is going to open after so long. Soon, the constant silence of this place will end. A new light will enter through the gate and the dust will rise from the worn tiles and damp wood of the pews. Everything must be perfect. Everything in place and ready. I am the child of the mass. This is my calling.
RosaryBead/RB105_CAPTION: Cloistered Ruby
RosaryBead/RB105_DESCRIPTION: A crystal sphere imprisoning a ruby heart. The gem sparkles with lightning from other lands, filling the glass with a stormy light. The strange energy fills the wearer with determination, electrifying the very air around him after drinking from the Bile Flask.
RosaryBead/RB105_LORE: The same is true for everything that is valuable and precious. If you keep something very precious so it cannot be seen or coveted by other eyes, reserving it only for the Father, that treasure will receive the greatest of blessings. We will cover up the sheen of this stone and make sure that no one knows of its existence.
RosaryBead/RB106_CAPTION: Bead of Gold Thread
RosaryBead/RB106_DESCRIPTION: A ball made of liquid gold, spun into fine fibres. Viscous to the touch, these miraculous strands are avidly coveted by alchemists and scholars. The passion woven into each filament seeps into the sacred Bile Flasks, accelerating their use.
RosaryBead/RB106_LORE: A miracle occurred in front of me. I found her lying on the floor. Her face was pale, as if dead, yet relaxed and at peace. Next to her, lay the bodies of four women covered in gold that shone and illuminated the room as if lit by an internal fire. From where I stood, I could hear the beating of those five hearts; they echoed in the room, slowly sounding in unison. @@There were golden threads at my feet, all over the room; they seemed to be attached to those golden bodies. I took up part of that thread and made a ball. That would be the proof for the others to believe me.
RosaryBead/RB107_CAPTION: Cloistered Sapphire
RosaryBead/RB107_DESCRIPTION: A crystal sphere imprisoning a sapphire heart. The gem sparkles with lightning from other lands, filling the glass with a stormy light. The strange energy fills the wearer with determination, electrifying the very air around him after he performs an Execution.
RosaryBead/RB107_LORE: All those who have wanted to isolate themselves, all those who have freely locked themselves away as a chosen way of life, will have the blessing of the Miracle. No one can serve two masters: either you serve the Miracle, or you serve the world. When you are in this cloister, remember these words, sister.
RosaryBead/RB108_CAPTION: Fire Enclosed in Enamel
RosaryBead/RB108_DESCRIPTION: A glossy medal, which holds a wild fire of the purest of whites. Jewels like this used to be hung from the mainmast, to capture the bright lights that appear on the high seas. It aids the connection with the Miracle, accelerating the use of the Prayers.
RosaryBead/RB108_LORE: A livid fire arose from the top of the mast, a tongue of fire sometimes white, sometimes blue, dancing wildly and seeming not to diminish at all despite the terrible storm that fell upon us. It was the touch of the Father's finger, pointing down from on high to our boat. The furious light opened up a path through the night and guided us through the storm.
RosaryBead/RB10_CAPTION: Frozen Olive
RosaryBead/RB10_DESCRIPTION: Summer fruit trapped in an endless winter. Born from an olive tree turned into a prison, its frosted oils bolster the wearer's defences when their strength is nearly exhausted.
RosaryBead/RB10_LORE: As Gemino traversed the path of the Frozen Olive Trees with the rest of the damned, towards the terrible hollow metal statues where those that awaited would die abandoned, he stepped barefoot on a fallen olive that had not yet disappeared under the snow. Without drawing attention, he picked it up and squeezed it in his hands, knowing it would be the last thing he'd treasure.
RosaryBead/RB11_CAPTION: Quirce's Scorched Bead
RosaryBead/RB11_DESCRIPTION: Small sphere carved on the remains of an unjustly lit bonfire. It burns with the soft embers of those flames, which could not touch Quirce's skin. Imbued with his power, it gives great protection against fire.
RosaryBead/RB11_LORE: Legend of Quirce. @@The horrifying flames consumed Quirce's body as he cried out in unbearable pain. But these were not ordinary flames: they were the flames of the Miracle. The flames burned him to ashes and, before the eyes of the inquisitors, the flames brought him back, time after time, in unparalleled torture. Burning and burning again. Screaming and screaming again. Quirce, the son of the bonfires, knew what his penance was going to be.
RosaryBead/RB12_CAPTION: Wicker Knot
RosaryBead/RB12_DESCRIPTION: Bead braided in a spiral motion, covered with a light coat of varnish that has protected it from the wear and tear of the years. A mother's hands worked these strands and blessed them. Their influence provides protection from toxic damage.
RosaryBead/RB12_LORE: When she was to be taken to the campfire, the inquisitors took the baby from her arms, and she screamed, begging for the child to not see her burn. The boy, who stared at her from afar, drenched in tears, was blindfolded: the blindfold was immediately moistened. The bonfire was surrounded by people, there to see the execution. They screamed, calling her a witch and heretic. When the flames started licking the pile of firewood, she asked a kind soul to build a wicker figure in her image and size, and to place the child in its arms so the baby would not miss her. And so they did, and when the figure was built, they placed the bawling child in its arms, and the orphan immediately stopped crying. The Miracle was merciful once again. 
RosaryBead/RB13_CAPTION: Perpetva's Protection
RosaryBead/RB13_DESCRIPTION: Ribbon of crimson cloth, carefully rolled and still scented with ancient oils. Members of The Anointed Legion wrapped their bodies in these soft ribbons anointed with protective oils, which contrasted with their otherwise heavy armour. The determination of its former wearer offers protection against lightning attacks. 
RosaryBead/RB13_LORE: "Esdras, you say?" spoke the soldier, "That madman could not bear the death of his sister. He's still talking to her as if she were there beside him. Sometimes it even seems as if they were arguing. He's long gone and hasn't been seen since".
RosaryBead/RB14_CAPTION: Thorned Symbol
RosaryBead/RB14_DESCRIPTION: Thorns braided with enormous patience by calloused hands, creating a protective symbol. Only unwavering conviction could prompt the creation of an item like this, and these feelings permeate its prickly surface. It protects its wearer from damage through contact.
RosaryBead/RB14_LORE: I'm still inside the creature. I can hear its roar outside, I can hear the thunderous beating of its heart. I just wanted to sleep, but I saw the Miracle in my dreams. It spoke to me. That is why I lie down in the Lady's open arms. But the Miracle appeared to me again. It was more and more tangible. Then I woke up, but I was no longer myself. I was a prisoner trapped inside a rooted body. A body immersed in constant anger. In constant pain. I am awake in a sleeping body.
RosaryBead/RB15_CAPTION: Piece of a Tombstone
RosaryBead/RB15_DESCRIPTION: Piece of a ceramic slab, strangely found on the snowy peaks. Those from the village rarely left their arid lands to face the cold of the mountains, but this tombstone had undoubtedly belonged to someone from Albero. The fragment confers resistance to falls, eliminating recovery time. 
RosaryBead/RB15_LORE: It is said that the Albero graveyard is even older than Albero itself. It was built even before the church was erected. It was a graveyard isolated from everything in this arid, ochre land, considered unholy. The church did not take long to find out about this, and dug all the tombs up, scattering the remains across the fields. That's when the brotherhood of the Genuine Sepulchre was founded, in charge of collecting the remains of the dead and giving them a second burial. I have kept this piece of clay tombstone since then.
RosaryBead/RB16_CAPTION: Sphere of the Sacred Smoke
RosaryBead/RB16_DESCRIPTION: Small, translucent pearl, with a closing mechanism that's almost impossible to see. They were traditionally filled with the vapours coming from the big incense burners, in the Mother of Mothers. This bead, however, contains something different. Its miraculous influence fills the bile flasks after some attacks, but the Miracle is capricious, and this does not happen often. 
RosaryBead/RB16_LORE: "...Once everyone had left, she approached the bonfire, still smoking with the scorched remains of the heretic. With a swift gesture of her fingers, she triggered the imperceptible lock that would open the tiny jewelled pearl in two and, passing it through the grey smoke, she closed it again, trusting that it would preserve that smoke forever..."
RosaryBead/RB17_CAPTION: Small Bead of Red Wax
RosaryBead/RB17_DESCRIPTION: Tiny pebble of melted wax, of a muted crimson. Prayers muttered in its presence slightly strengthen the vitality of the wearer.
RosaryBead/RB17_LORE: The abbey ceased to be a quiet place. Cries of pain coming from every cell pierced the walls. The old friar knew he would be next, so he got up from his cot, where he had been huddled, and glanced at the few items that lay on his table, most of them mementos from his life before joining the Order. He wanted to be kissed by the Miracle while immersed in those gentle thoughts. Triggering most memories were some small balls of wax, now covered in dust, that he used to enlarge by picking up wax from the candles during processions.
RosaryBead/RB18_CAPTION: Medium Bead of Red Wax
RosaryBead/RB18_DESCRIPTION: Sphere of accumulated crimson wax. Echoes of ancient prayers resound in its core, and moderately reinforce the vitality of the wearer.
RosaryBead/RB18_LORE: The abbey ceased to be a quiet place. Cries of pain coming from every cell pierced the walls.

Triggering most memories were some small balls of wax, now covered in dust, that he used to enlarge by picking up wax from the candles during processions.
RosaryBead/RB19_CAPTION: Big Bead of Red Wax
RosaryBead/RB19_DESCRIPTION: Large accumulation of wax of a brilliant crimson. Ancestral prayers roar in it, and it considerably reinforces the vitality of the wearer.

Triggering most memories were some small balls of wax, now covered in dust, that he used to enlarge by picking up wax from the candles during processions.
RosaryBead/RB201_CAPTION: Light of the Lady of the Lamp
RosaryBead/RB201_DESCRIPTION: An iron amulet, forged in the shape of a lantern and rusted by humidity and saltpetre. Sailors wore it so the Lady of the Lamp might find them if they fell overboard. It is still impregnated with the feverish prayers of its last owner, increasing all defences when flasks run empty. @It was of little use to the poor ruffian, for all defence is useless against the mighty seas, and the Lady of the Lamp pays no heed to superstitions.
RosaryBead/RB201_LORE: “Only a dozen of us survived the storm. In the night, the waters were black and freezing and remained still. We tried to swim to keep ourselves warm and, with a bit of luck, find some driftwood to cling onto and rest. We tried to find one another, but our cries were muffled in strange echoes, making it impossible to work out where they were coming from. When the cries began to die out we realised that the frozen darkness would be our grave. But in that moment, from out of the shadowy mists, a white light appeared, a light that was heading our way. Then, one by one, a young man with a lantern on his boat, pulled us from our watery fate. Once he had got us back to dry land, he went on his way without a word. Although we never knew his name, one thing’s for sure, we shall never forget him.@And strike me dead if all that I say is not the truth!”
RosaryBead/RB202_CAPTION: Scale of Burnished Alabaster
RosaryBead/RB202_DESCRIPTION: A fragment of a real scale and hard as stone. Its whiteness is so pure that it glows brightly under the palest of lights, especially when danger approaches the one who wears it. Its lunar light allows the Penitent One to block attacks from behind.
RosaryBead/RB202_LORE: “Captain,@We have been in this black fog for what we now believe to be five days. Nothing moves, nothing lives, nothing breathes here. All is echoes and shadows. Not even the boat creaks or sways on these oily black waters. And nor is there any sign of the Serpent.@We feel as if we are slowly sinking, for the reflection of our tired and emaciated faces on the water’s surface seems, with each passing moment, to be ever closer. This will no doubt be our grave, there is no way back. @We pray that this message in a bottle reaches you. It has been an honour to serve under you.@May the sea have mercy on us.”
RosaryBead/RB203_CAPTION: The Young Mason’s Wheel
RosaryBead/RB203_DESCRIPTION: The remains of a miniature wooden cart, worn by an apprentice who was separated from his master in a terrible accident. The stone and mortar that enveloped him drowned out his cries, preserving his pleas for help in a freakish echo that now permeates these walls with clarity. This amulet is now imbued with the poor lad’s longing for release, increasing the speed of movement of whoever wears it.
RosaryBead/RB203_LORE: “Father, the walls do not move. @The library does not wish its wisdom to escape these enclosures. Its corridors deceive and confine all those who enter in search of its forbidden tomes and ancient secrets. Its wardens, the silent monks who wander between its shelves, know this and are themselves captives of its power. Here, we shall remain forever with a thirst for knowledge never to be sated. I hope one day you will read these words and not blame yourself for my death. The penned word wanted it so.”
RosaryBead/RB204_CAPTION: Crown of Gnawed Iron
RosaryBead/RB204_DESCRIPTION: An engagement ring forged in iron and blackened from the many times it was cast into the flames. The teeth of three jaws lovingly form its miniature crown-like shape. The combination of spite and desire lends it power, increasing the fervour generated by the Penitent One’s attacks.
RosaryBead/RB204_LORE: “At times when I pray within these sacred walls of peace, I sense the presence of the Lady of the Bandaged Sword. At times, I hear her breathing behind her golden helmet that blinkers her eyes, as she waits in silence, cloaked in darkness. At times, I hear her murmuring what sound like never-ending prayers. And yet, I have never seen her enter nor leave this place. What or who can she be waiting for?”
RosaryBead/RB20_CAPTION: Little Toe made of Limestone
RosaryBead/RB20_DESCRIPTION: Toe from the statue of the First Barefoot Pilgrim. The vestigial little toe pushed the stones out of his path. Increases dodging distance.
RosaryBead/RB20_LORE: The Master gathered us all together, like every morning, and said: "A genuine genuflecting pilgrim must never divert their eyes from the earth they walk on. For this is our rule."
RosaryBead/RB21_CAPTION: Big Toe made of Limestone
RosaryBead/RB21_DESCRIPTION: A toe from the statue of the First Barefoot Pilgrim. This strong big toe left its mark on the secret routes. Adds extra thrust while in the air.
RosaryBead/RB21_LORE: And he went on to say: "A genuine genuflecting pilgrim will always have his hands tied behind his back during his travels, as his feet are the only thing that should matter to him. For that is our rule."
RosaryBead/RB22_CAPTION: Fourth Toe made of Limestone
RosaryBead/RB22_DESCRIPTION: Toe from the statue of the First Barefoot Pilgrim. The fourth toe bore the memory of his partner, so as not to forget better times. Reduces dodging cooldown.
RosaryBead/RB22_LORE: Finally he said "A genuine genuflecting pilgrim will always walk alone. It is the solitary path that will grant him constant meditation and understanding of what it means to be a pilgrim in the land of the Miracle. For that is our rule." Then he got up, and looked at all of us for a long time while we remained silent. Then he left, and we never saw him again.
RosaryBead/RB24_CAPTION: Small Bead of Blue Wax
RosaryBead/RB24_DESCRIPTION: Tiny pebble of melted wax, of a dusty cerulean. The cries from tortured zealots still reverberate inside, and it slightly strengthens the wearer's fervour.
RosaryBead/RB24_LORE: "The abbey ceased to be a quiet place. Cries of pain coming from every cell pierced the walls.

He wanted to be kissed by the Miracle while immersed in those gentle thoughts. Triggering most memories were some small balls of wax, now covered in dust, that he used to enlarge by picking up wax from the candles during processions."
RosaryBead/RB28_CAPTION: Pelican Effigy
RosaryBead/RB28_DESCRIPTION: Bead made of forged copper, coated in a dense aquamarine patina. The pelican fed its children with its blood. Protects the wearer from all harm while they drink from the bile flask.
RosaryBead/RB28_LORE: May our chest full of cuts bleed. For when it spills red, it will feed the hungry. Let it bleed. For when it pours upon this land of the dead, it shall be blessed in the eyes of the Miracle, and those who rest here shall live on the other side of the Dream, on the Way of Eternal Processions. Let it bleed.
RosaryBead/RB301_CAPTION: Crimson Heart of a Miura
RosaryBead/RB301_DESCRIPTION: A strange artifact, said to be found within the corpse of the fiercest of bulls. Also called the Egg of the Sovereign, the twisted features of its surface stir under the torment of its wearer, increasing attack speed when their health is low. @A glint catches in Its clouded eyes,  the reflection of a eclipse of a foreign, invisible sun. A permanent mark caused by a masterpiece that trascends all and any borders.
RosaryBead/RB301_LORE: "Thank you for everything, master."
RosaryBead/RB30_CAPTION: Drop of Coagulated Ink
RosaryBead/RB30_DESCRIPTION: Each hesitation of the scribe was a new stain on his scriptorium. Words not written, censored before they were born onto the paper, were powerful, too. This cluster of ink grazed by the Affliction increases the power of Prayers.
RosaryBead/RB30_LORE: The scribe had raised his gaze, for he had ceased to write a while ago.
RosaryBead/RB31_CAPTION: Amber Eye
RosaryBead/RB31_DESCRIPTION: Bead carefully carved in the shape of an eyeball that appears to glint in the dark. A sacred tree was struck by lightning, but did not suffer any damage. Its resin did not allow the lightning to escape, so it still remains in the amber nucleus, providing great protection against electrical attacks. 
RosaryBead/RB31_LORE: This was the first frozen tree, the first for which we all kneeled to pray, the first in which one could see a face, pious and sorrowful, among the deformities of the pale, frozen trunk. One day it wept from the concavities that shaped his eyes. He wept sap, so golden, so brilliant... The Amber Eye...
RosaryBead/RB32_CAPTION: Muted Bell
RosaryBead/RB32_DESCRIPTION: Tin bell, now empty. Strangely, one could swear to hear a slight tinkling in the presence of strange energies. Slightly protects its wearer from attacks of magical nature.
RosaryBead/RB32_LORE: When he entered that room full of paintings and statues, he was surprised to find, under a dirty sheet, the marble figure of a man who seemed to offer him something. Something lustrous that he held in his cold stone hands caught his attention: a shapeless fruit, the size of an apple, with a silvery glow and a delicious appearance. Hungry as he was, he took it, but when he tried to bite it he had to hold back a yelp of pain, for the fruit turned out to be made of metal. Confused, he grabbed a nearby stone and smashed the fruit with all his might, managing to make a small crack in it, from which a dense reddish liquid poured. Without thinking it twice, he drank the liquid, which tasted salty like blood.
RosaryBead/RB33_CAPTION: Consecrated Amethyst
RosaryBead/RB33_DESCRIPTION: A gem that gives off an intense aroma of incense. In the Mother of Mothers, the ornate incense burners were filled with precious gems and beads, consecrating them with their vapours. This amethyst comes from the greatest of them all, and its blessing gives the wearer great protection against magical attacks. 
RosaryBead/RB33_LORE: Take all the jewels, all the precious stones, all the gold from those chests to consecrate him, for today we will clothe the saint and raise his body to the highest. 
RosaryBead/RB34_CAPTION: Embers of a Broken Star
RosaryBead/RB34_DESCRIPTION: Unfamiliar mineral, found in a deep crevice by a forgotten miner. The poor soul lost his mind in the labyrinth of its facets, which reflect a non-existent light.@It increases the Fervour generated with attacks.
RosaryBead/RB34_LORE: I found it! It's the light of the star! What they were saying is true. Something was shining in this frozen darkness. The light of the star was calling us... It wanted to get out... It wanted to return to the heavens, but now it won't be possible, for now it's mine...
RosaryBead/RB35_CAPTION: Scaly Coin
RosaryBead/RB35_DESCRIPTION: Disturbing golden disc, covered by the dry moult of a reptile. The bas-relief of a claw was considered a symbol of greed, and increases the number of Tears of Atonement harvested with each attack.
RosaryBead/RB35_LORE: Look at this page, at the drawings it contains... A horse reading the Holy Scriptures, monkeys dressed as bishops, and a reptile being worshipped by a crowd. Do you hear those murmurs? It is the brothers, warning us of the danger of these pages. We must leave this book in its place. 
RosaryBead/RB36_CAPTION: Seashell of the Inverted Spiral
RosaryBead/RB36_DESCRIPTION: Seashell with impossible curves, found on the sand. Its shape caught the echoes of a painful song, which increase in intensity with the suffering of the wearer. It provides some protection against all elemental damage.
RosaryBead/RB36_LORE: That seashell was of great value to her. She recounted that the shell had its spiral inverted, and that this was why, when she held it close to her ear, she could hear the sound of the waves moving away. Her parents, faced with what seemed like a confession of insanity, and out of fear that there was something of witchcraft in that cursed object, took it away and threw it off the cliff. She, in spite of all her efforts, never managed to find that seashell.
RosaryBead/RB37_CAPTION: Calcified Eye of Erudition
RosaryBead/RB37_DESCRIPTION: Eyeball belonging to Alavaroz the scribe, who glimpsed the truth hidden to so many other eyes. Its stony scrutiny reveals the vital essence of enemies.
RosaryBead/RB37_LORE: His body was immobilized, and amid cries of repentance his skin began to turn whiter and whiter until it finally became limestone. As he was about to become a complete statue, in a final sigh his tears softened one of his eyes that he managed to separate himself from the rest of the body by falling to the ground. Then we discreetly moved her rigid body of lime from her cell to the lower parts of the archicatedral along with the other forbidden statues, we put a wide loom over her so that no one else would know that under her would sleep, punished by the miracle, the Great Scribe.
RosaryBead/RB38_CAPTION: Immaculate Bead
RosaryBead/RB38_DESCRIPTION: Simple bead, devoid of purpose. Its pristine surface has never been soiled by fervent fingers.
RosaryBead/RB38_LORE: "I have something for you, and for you alone..." revealed the gipsy to a monk who had just stopped his donkey, as she uncovered a white stone possessing a strange beauty. "It comes from the darkness of the ocean floor. Contemplate its purity, look at its immaculate white, its virgin brilliance... What could be purer than this for your rosary, brother?"
RosaryBead/RB39_CAPTION: Bead Marked by Guilt
RosaryBead/RB39_DESCRIPTION: Bead that has absorbed the Guilt of its bearer. It may be difficult to perceive the dark macula that twists inside, but the cold it gives to the touch leaves no room for doubt. Wearing it in your rosary prevents the accumulation of Guilt in the world, at least while the bead retains part of its purity. 
RosaryBead/RB39_LORE: "I have something for you, and for you alone..." revealed the gipsy to a monk who had just stopped his donkey, as she uncovered a white stone possessing a strange beauty. "It comes from the darkness of the ocean floor. Contemplate its purity, look at its immaculate white, its virgin brilliance... What could be purer than this for your rosary, brother?"
RosaryBead/RB40_CAPTION: Bead Tainted by Guilt
RosaryBead/RB40_DESCRIPTION: Bead that has absorbed the Guilt of its bearer on several occasions. In its nucleus there lies a black spiral, twisting and stirring in outbursts of wrath. Wearing it in your rosary prevents the accumulation of Guilt in the world, at least while the bead retains part of its purity. 
RosaryBead/RB40_LORE: "I have something for you, and for you alone..." revealed the gipsy to a monk who had just stopped his donkey, as she uncovered a white stone possessing a strange beauty. "It comes from the darkness of the ocean floor. Contemplate its purity, look at its immaculate white, its virgin brilliance... What could be purer than this for your rosary, brother?"
RosaryBead/RB41_CAPTION: Weight of True Guilt
RosaryBead/RB41_DESCRIPTION: Bead completely tainted that has absorbed the sins of its wearer until completely filled. Encloses a storm of Guilt, and rumbles with the echoes of past mistakes.@Statues of Confessors used to carry beads like this, reaping Guilt from repentant parishioners.
RosaryBead/RB41_LORE: "I have something for you, and for you alone..." revealed the gipsy to a monk who had just stopped his donkey, as she uncovered a white stone possessing a strange beauty. "It comes from the darkness of the ocean floor. Contemplate its purity, look at its immaculate white, its virgin brilliance... What could be purer than this for your rosary, brother?"
RosaryBead/RB42_CAPTION: Bust Carved in Ivory
RosaryBead/RB42_DESCRIPTION: Polished effigy depicting the face of a cherub. Only the Son of the Moon is capable of creating such an amulet, capable of summoning a guardian to accompany its bearer. Slightly increases the gain of Fervour and Tears of Atonement, and helps find the lost brothers.
RosaryBead/RB42_LORE: A strong light came in through the main stained glass window and, despite its intensity, I stared at it; it dazzled me, but I didn't care. Without looking away, I saw small silhouettes coming down, and they seemed to be dancing and playing up in the air. My heart was filled with joy, and I raised my arms so as to touch them, but when I recovered my vision, the figures were no longer there.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0001_0: In the name of the Great Ordeal and the Sons of the Miracle.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0002_0: May the gold in my visage melt and erase the Attrition of your soul.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0003_0: May the gold in my visage melt and erase the Contrition of your soul.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0004_0: May the gold in my visage melt and erase the Compunction of your soul.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0005_0: Heart of guilt, return now from the dream.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0010_0: When you humbled yourself before my most holy body, you have been granted the presence of my golden visage, custodian of one of the Three Sorrows of the soul in penance.
ST00_PENITENT/DLG_0010_1: Our Miracle has chosen me amongst all the pious, just as it chose you, to walk on this sacred sea.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0101_0: Regretful be the heart, Penitent One. The anguish of the Eldest Brother has now come to an end.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0101_1: I am Deogracias, witness to and narrator of the acts of the Grievous Miracle. Such is my penance, as yours is silence.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0102_0: You have carried out the first Humiliation of Penance.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0103_0: You have been allowed to meet the Visage of Contrition.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0104_0: You have met the Visage of Attrition.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0105_0: You have yet to prostrate before two last Holy Visages.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0106_0: You have yet to prostrate before one last Holy Visage.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0107_0: Penitent One in silence, after bowing before the Holy Custodian Visages, the door at the end of the Bridge of Calvary has been opened.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0107_1: Traverse now its threshold under the strict eye of His Holiness.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0107_2: We penitents carry such guilt that perhaps the Affliction is giving us a second breath. But be wary: amongst prayers it might silently come creeping to us one day.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0108_0: You have been allowed to behold the Visage of Compunction.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0109_0: You have carried out the second Humiliation of Penance.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01101_0: It is not possible...
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01101_1: That which bears hundreds of years of oblivion has returned.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01101_2: It has returned...
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01102_0: I heard the iron creak, quake and bend. From afar, I saw that more branches had grown from this reddish tree. 
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01102_1: What new trial does the Miracle have in store for us now? What new revelation?
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01103_0: What has happened will stay between the Ancient Miracle and you.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_01104_0: What has been forgotten must remain forgotten.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0111_0: Sorrowful be the Heart, Penitent One.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0112_0: It is a remote place separated from the rest of these lands by a great sacred and forbidden door.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0113_0: Even a wise penitent like me knows nothing of what lies beyond those high walls.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0113_1: However, what I do know is that, according to The Rule, one must carry out the Three Humiliations to gain access to what they guard.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0114_0: Take this thorn and place it on the handle of your sword.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0114_1: If, when the time comes, as you grip your weapon firmly, you notice that it wounds you, and makes you bleed...
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0114_2: Having grown, with more thorns sprouting from it, writhing over the figure of the Father carved into the knob...
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0114_3: That will mean that you are at the mercy of the Grievous Miracle, whether for its punishment or its forgiveness.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0115_0: One of them must be performed in the high mountains, covered in thick blankets of snow and ice.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0115_1: Another in the depths of a dark, entombed church, where the sleeper lies.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0115_2: And the last one at the end of the trail carved by moans that claw their way out of an iron spiral. In the bowels of the bell named Jondo that grows into the earth.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0116_0: The one you have pulled from Punishment was Quirce, one of the Sheltered.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0116_1: He was unjustly condemned to the stake for heresy, and the inquisitors bore witness to the flames engulfing his body amidst an atrocious communion of prayers and cries.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0116_2: Still, when it was over, and the flames had died, the merciful Miracle called them forth again, and from them, from the ashes and embers, the body of Quirce rose anew.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0116_3: For fiery are the paths of the Miracle.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0117_0: Those you have removed from Punishment were Perpetva and Esdras, foundling siblings who went on to be part of His Holiness' Guard.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0117_1: It was said that Perpertva could speak to her brother even after death.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0117_2: For twisted are the paths of the Miracle.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_0: The Knot of the Three Words. Here is where the First Miracle took place. One devout and tormented youngster asked the High Will for punishment.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_1: He placed a wooden log where he sat and prayed. He prayed hoping to be heard.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_2: He prayed for pain, so he could ease the guilt that sharply pierced his soul. Then the Miracle manifested itself.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_3: It made roots grow and twist over his arms and legs, but not a cry nor a complaint came out from his mouth.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_4: Every inhabitant of this land bore witness to it, and all of them prayed before the besought eternal joy of that youngster.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_5: This triune tree that sprouted years after his death was named The Knot of the Three Words, for three are its twisted trunks, and three were the words spoken by that youngster before he died: My Great Guilt.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_6: Every year, from its core, flows a golden, burning liquid, perpetuating his memory, and, perhaps, to remind us that the First Miracle has not abandoned us.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0118_7: For twisted are, were and will be, the paths of the Miracle.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0120_0: You have freed His Holiness from his afflicted torment, and now he walks by the old processions on the other side of the Dream.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0120_1: The Cradle of the Grievous Miracle, the final relic, the grail of blood and gold that emanated from the forehead of the Father as he silently lamented the moment of his blessed twisting.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0120_2: That first relic is here, at the top of the ashen mountain next to the Turned Throne where His Holiness was kissed by our Miraculous Pain.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0120_3: And now your final communion with the Miracle awaits.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0120_4: Only you will be able to know how much of it has seeped into your guilty heart.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0121_0: Here lies the door on whose bronze the ordeals of those chosen by the Miracle are perpetuated.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0121_1: On it, for the art of these images to be worshipped and revered, ornamentation must take place.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0121_2: His sculpted Holiness watches us, rigid, from on high, but it is the relief of the bronze that dictates who is worthy of passing under its adorned arch.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0121_3: Find the Holy Visages, and the Bronze will know.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0121_4: For fickle are the wishes of the Miracle.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0122_0: Your communion with the First Miracle awaits.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0123_0: And thus came the moment of final communion with the sword born of guilt. A last sacrifice in order to finish penance and break off with the ungodly will of the Grievous Miracle.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0123_1: But the plans of the Miracle are capricious. Penance never ends, but changes, hurts and condemns at will.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0123_2: There is no place for the Penitent One on the other side of the dream. His place is here, among us.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0123_3: He is the new Father and the last son of the Miracle.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0123_4: Recipient of our prayers.
ST01_DEOSGRACIAS/DLG_0123_5: For ever and ever.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_0: O, Penitent One! We traverse strange roads under the same firmament. With nay other trade, nay other name.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_1: My name is Redento, barefoot pilgrim of the Order of the Genuflectors.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_2: Prithee taketh nay affront in my not looking at thy visage, for we at each moment lean forth, so as not to divert our eyes from the path. Such is our olde precept.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_3: We are before Jondo, the great buried bell, erected upside down so that its ringing would make the earth tremble and reach distant lands.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_4: Now Jondo resoundeth in a deep triune moan, that traveleth in echoes through its broad spiralling circles.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_5: My feet wish to cross to the other side of this ancient valley to move onto the next destination.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0201_6: Oh, my sins! Who could help me?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0202_0: Penitent One, may thy trades silence neither thy spirit nor thy frame.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0203_0: Oh! Thou art the answer to my prayers! The Order thanketh thee for thine aid.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0203_1: It is of little use for me to remain here. Go with the Father, oh Penitent One.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0204_0: On the path lies the solace and the life. Prithee heed my prayers, Oh Lord of the bare feet!
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0204_1: Oh! Forgive me, Penitent One... Without my knowing, amidst prayers, our roads and faults become intertwined once more.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0205_0: Oh Penitent One! Is it true that the roads are free?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0205_1: Wondrous vision thou allowest me to behold. Blessed be our encounter.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0206_0: Bitter moments reunite us again, Penitent One.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0207_0: I am not worthy of thine infinite compassion. Blessed are those of us who find it.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0207_1: I will pray for thee and thank the Master for this holy encounter.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0207_2: Now my feet are marching towards Holy Prohibitions. How can a simple pilgrim advance through such fortification?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0207_3: Oh, Fraternal Father! Oh, master of pilgrims! How arduous are your upcoming trials?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0208_0: It is of little use for me to remain here. Go with the Father, oh Penitent One.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0209_0: Penitent One, heed my confession... Cowardice taketh root inside of me in the face of this new test by the Grievous Miracle.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0209_1: Who are we pilgrims, if not sinners who have chosen wandering as the gentlest of penances?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0209_2: Oh! Let my bent back cover my tears.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0210_0: Those screams filled my soul with fright...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0210_1: Thou hast purged my fears and helped this poor pilgrim again.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0210_2: We have chosen different roads, but still, absolution awaits at the end of the path for thee and this sinner. Wherever it is, near or far, in this life or on the other side of the Dream.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0210_3: Merciful be the heart, Penitent One.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0211_0: Oh, my sins! Is a long journey filled with reflection not enough?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0211_1: What of the calluses on the feet, the cramps in the legs, the thirst, the forehead scorched by a sun that seemeth never to set?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0211_2: And what about the torturing of the mind when guilt pierceth our hearts time after time?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0211_3: What more punishment do ye want, oh sins of mine?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0212_0: I halt here to look for a crossing to the other side, so as to continue my penance in wandering. Ah! Don't let it be a disturbance to thee, Penitent in guilt, for my feet will find their long-awaited walking.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0212_1: Penitent One, may thy trades silence neither thy spirit nor thy frame.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0213_0: Oh, sins of mine...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0214_0: Thou art before the First Pilgrim. The first of the Barefoot Rule, Master of all errant sinners.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0214_1: This old limestone statue was erected where the pilgrimage of the master ended, where he took his last step.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0214_2: It was then that the Miracle carried him in its arms so he could continue his path on the road of the old processions.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0215_0: Barefoot Master, what else dost thou want from me?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0216_0: Barefoot Master, wait for me...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0217_0: The Master showeth us the continuation of the path. New steps await us under the cold stone.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0218_0: Oh... Penitent One, we are surrounded by tragedy, death and pain...
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0218_1: The Miracle punishes us with its many terrible hands, hands that reach everywhere, into all hearts and even into our thoughts.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0218_2: Is there worse punishment than the one for which we do not know the reason?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0219_0: An insurmountable wall seemeth to interpose itself between our feet and our holy destinations.
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0219_1: Will there ever be a blessing that saveth us from this sorrow?
ST02_REDENTO/DLG_0220_0: What can I do to avoid the difficulties that the Miracle layeth in front of my bare feet?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_0: Sorrowful be the Heart, Penitent One. Welcome to Albero, sanctuary to this humble brotherhood of the Kissers of Wounds.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_1: Few remain here who can still employ it, but Tirso is my name.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_2: There are few of us who still care for the sick and ailing.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0301_3: With devout kisses, we bless the wounds of those who seek our protection, thus both we and they remain at the mercy of the Miracle.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0302_0: Sorrowful be the Heart, Penitent One full of clemency.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0303_0: The Miracle is taking us away, one after the other. Could we avoid this fate that is imposed on us from the High Wills?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0304_0: The Virtuous Pain flogs us time after time. Oh! When will it be satisifed?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0305_0: Penitent One, where will we go, afflicted and devout, when the sun of life sets on us?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0306_0: That which you carry with you... You have embraced...punishment, Penitent One. Is it your desire for the Miracle to keep you in mind more than the rest of us?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0306_1: It is not my responsibility, but beware of the twisted paths where that communion will lead you.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0307_0: How many more trials must we overcome?
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0308_0: We will soon be reunited with the Punishment and with the punished on the way of the Old Processions, on the other side of the Dream.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0309_0: The Miracle has been merciful to us.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0309_1: As long as this brotherhood has brothers, even if just one, there will be hope for the ill.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0309_2: Take this as a token of gratitude, Penitent One in piety.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0310_0: Merciful be, Penitent One. With your contribution, the work of this brotherhood carries on. 
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0311_0: Time outside these walls passes by strangely, in sundowns we need not contemplate.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0311_1: But if your penance happens to carry you under said skies, be so kind as to bring us some ingredients for our ointments.
ST03_TIRSO/DLG_0312_0: The will in the Miracle shall show you which ones they are.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0401_0: Thou hast called upon the Winch of the Order of the True Shrine.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_0: This poor lass...
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_1: Many tears were shed in her blessed name.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_2: A thousand prayers do not clarify whether or not the Grievous Miracle is a manifestation of true holiness...
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0402_3: Still, in our heart lieth no doubt that she was unjustly punished.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0403_0: The remnants of Tentudía have been gathered. It is now possible to give her the second, true burial.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0403_1: With this supplication she shall watch over thee.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_0: Then thou hast already met Cleofás...
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_1: He was once a member of this congregation. One woeful day he broke his vows, and left upon hearing the news that...a miracle had occurred.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_2: We never heard from him again.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0404_3: Please give him this. It will mean a lot to him.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0405_0: The Order blesses thee, Penitent One in silence.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0406_0: Find the next remnants. The Order blesses thee.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0407_0: In this place we gather the remains of those who were separated and forgotten, so we can grant them holy burial as our charitable Rule prescribeth.
ST04_LVDOVICO/DLG_0407_1: Helpest these poor souls, Oh Penintent one in silence. The Order blesses you.
ST04_LVDOVICO/MSG_0404_0: No answer.
ST05_DAGGER/DLG_0502_0: Take the next of my deep pains.
ST05_DAGGER/DLG_0503_0: Take the last one of these pains of mine, the deepest and sharpest of them all.
ST05_DAGGER/DLG_0503_1: Now depart towards the Cradle of Punishment, oh Penitent One in guilt.
ST05_DAGGER/MSG_0501_0: Maximum health has increased.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0601_0: From a place of blessings have I been entrusted with watching over you, Penitent One. Thus it has been arranged.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0601_1: My name is Viridiana. I have been granted a gift with which I can assist you in carrying your burden if required, but only you can make that choice. 
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0602_A_0: So be it.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0602_B_0: So be it.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0602_C_0: So be it.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0603_A_0: Here I shall remain, lest you change your mind.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0603_B_0: Here I shall remain, lest you change your mind.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0603_C_0: Here I shall remain, lest you change your mind.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0604_0: Penitent One, do not be troubled by me or my outward appearance, now changed and seasoned. This might be... a small price to pay for such joyous alliance.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0605_0: Pay no heed to the wrinkles of my skin, the hair that grows silvery or my trembling legs. Our pact has yet to be concluded, as has your arduous enterprise.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0606_0: I feel fortunate to partake in this victory.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0606_1: Before I depart, I want these words to accompany you, so that you remember our pact.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0607_0: Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_0: What you seek lies at the end of these long stairs.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_1: That which proclaimed itself The True and Holy Truth has long been hiding there.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_2: Behind those doors, The Affliction itself laments in its own confusion and deformity.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_3: The journey has been long, but your task is about to be completed.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_A_4: Although I have been barred from entering such a slanderous abode, these words are free to accompany you.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_0: What you seek lies at the end of these long stairs.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_1: That which proclaimed itself The True and Holy Truth has long been hiding there.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_2: Behind those doors, The Affliction itself laments in its own confusion and deformity.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_3: The journey has been long, but your task is about to be completed.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_B_4: Although I have been barred from entering such a slanderous abode, these words are free to accompany you.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_0: What you seek lies at the end of these long stairs.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_1: That which proclaimed itself The True and Holy Truth has long been hiding there.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_2: Behind those doors, The Affliction itself laments in its own confusion and deformity.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_3: The journey has been long, but your task is about to be completed.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0608_C_4: Although I have been barred from entering such a slanderous abode, these words are free to accompany you.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0609_A_0: Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey. I will guard you from afar.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0609_B_0: Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey. I will guard you from afar.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_0609_C_0: Penitent One in silence, now resume your journey. I will guard you from afar.
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_QT_0601_0: Penitent One in silence, will you require my assistance with your next task?
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_QT_0602_0: My protection does not cease here. Will you require my assistance with your next task? 
ST06_VIRIDIANA/DLG_QT_0603_0: Penitent One, will you require my assistance with your next task?
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_0: Contrite and humiliated be the heart, Penitent One in silence. You stand before what remains of Gémino.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_1: Oh, do not fret for me. The cold is merciful, for it relieves our pain and numbs us before it leads us to our deaths.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_2: Perhaps the Miracle the others spoke of has come to me, here in this iron tomb, lengthening distress more and more...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0701_3: To a promised land you direct your march, to the place where the frozen and the burning embrace in communion...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0702_0: Now, let my numbed arm become another branch of this withered olive tree.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0702_1: Hurry up, I can still hear the call.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0703_0: I feel the boiling oil entering my frigid veins.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0703_1: I can still answer the call...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0704_0: I feel the boiling oil entering my veins as it mixes with the frozen sap.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0704_1: I can no longer hear the others, only the crunch of my bones, of my skin...
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0705_0: Let me ask of you the favour of bringing me a few drops of the oils that once came out of these icy olive trees, the ones that ended up scorching the faces of every pious person who ever reached the summit.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0705_1: As my last wish, before it is too late for me, let me feel that pain.
ST07_GEMINO/DLG_0706_0: Take this.
ST07_GEMINO/MSG_0701_0: An item is needed to retrieve oil from the font.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_0: Sister of mine, as I foretold to you, someone is heading towards the forbidden gate.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_1: Someone who seeks the purge and excommunication of all that is sacred and rests there.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_2: No... No... Do not place your doubts on me.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0801_3: I am ready.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0802_0: Indeed, sister of mine. Our encounter is approaching.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0802_1: The Miracle will protect me. I do not need your protection this time.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_0802_2: Leave me alone.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08201_0: That elusive light...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08201_1: It can't be her...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08201_2: Is that true, sister?
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_0: Virtuous Penitent One, this was the place where your sword was born of guilt itself, bringing pain to the flesh as the soul could suffer no more.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_1: The voice of my sister, may the glories protect her, recited verses to me as tender as they were wise, her words revealing a different destiny for you.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_2: Further away, although not in distance. Woven in shadows, though full of light.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08202_3: I have been guarding this key for a long time now.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_0: Is this really the sublime light of your virtue?
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_1: So...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_2: You have received the much esteemed and blessed favour of my sister.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08203_3: With her blessing she has given you the ability to hear her noble voice, full of grace.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08204_0: It will open the door behind which lies that which the holiness itself condemned to eternal reclusion.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08204_1: But I no longer have the power, nor the words, to describe it...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08204_2: Head for the Library of the Negated Words. There you'll find the keeper of keys, although the one I am entrusting you with is missing from his collection.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08205_0: Something has changed in her...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08205_1: Something unfathomable that escapes my judgement...
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08206_0: Head for the Library of the Negated Words and look for the key bearer.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08207_0: The hands hewn in the gold of Crisanta's helmet eschew the glare of the truth that you must understand.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08207_1: Her faith will never let this light pass. Not even you believed in her.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08208_0: Penitent One. Meet me in the chapel where Guilt was given shape.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08208_1: Where you were anointed the Penitent One and where you knelt for the first time.
ST08_BROTHERS/DLG_08208_2: It will be in this remote place that my sister will hear my plea, and will send her Voice to me once again.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0901_0: Oh... Behold, gracious lady. A visitor...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0901_1: Oh, please forgive me... Penitent One, you stand in the presence of Socorro, our Pious Lady of the Perpetual Agony.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0901_2: Isn't she majestic? She is a miracle in herself... Unceasing... Eternal...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0902_0: She suffers... For all of us... Day by day, with no rest, with no end...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0902_1: She is our living miracle, a true example of Holiness.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0903_0: What... What have you done? Our Lady...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0904_0: This...may be for the best... She had suffered enough...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0904_1: Is this...an act of true mercy?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0905_0: The Pain...runs free...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0906_0: The Pain is amongst us...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_0: I loved the Mercy incarnate in Her... and Her, the daughter of Mercy itself...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_1: How can I love the others more than holiness itself?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_2: The order... I remember it. Its Rule was my Rule some time ago...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_3: My thoughts are forlorn, Penitent One...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0907_4: I need to...pray.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0908_0: I have held vigil by her side for years.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0908_1: I have borne witness to each and every one of her sufferings, her lamentations, and her wounds... Which would heal only to bleed again, in an endless ordeal.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0909_0: Three penitents that communed with the Miracle clamoured for her refuge and protection.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0909_1: Those souls she suffered for have already departed to the other side of The Dream.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0910_0: Penitent One in charity, this is my new home and from here shall my vigil begin anew.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0910_1: Take these words I managed to transcribe from the voice of Our Lady amidst suffering, so they can become a prayer which you can raise in her memory.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0911_0: The Order blesses you, Penitent One in the righteous path.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0912_0: A tear has rolled off her cheek... Could it be that her torment has diminished?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0912_1: Our poor Lady...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_0: The Lady...
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_1: Three penitents that communed with the Miracle clamoured for her refuge and protection.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_2: Those souls for which she suffered have already departed to the other side of The Dream.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_3: Has the Holy Commandment of my Lady finished...? 
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0913_4: Penitent One... Whom shall I watch over now?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0914_0: Now she shall lament no more.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0915_0: Thank you, Penitent One in silence. It is my duty to watch over the others in the absence of Our Lady. The Order awaits me. 
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0916_0: I need to pray.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0917_0: Now she will not be able to shield the rest from the anguish of the blood.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0917_1: The same Affliction that in the past bestowed her with such sorrowful and miraculous favour has given birth to a new, terrible outbreak.
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_0917_2: Is this the punishment for so many years of holiness?
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_QT_0904_ANSWER_0: Make an offering
ST09_SOCORRO/DLG_QT_0904_ANSWER_1: End her suffering
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_0: Two faces greet you, Penitent One. My name is Nacimiento.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_1: Look at my chest, upon which an ancient visage grows older and older. A face that does not speak, that does not think, while mine becomes younger such that I now look like a child.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_2: Such a terrible sentence is this that I do not understand its purpose; no matter how much I reflect on the sins that I may have committed to deserve it.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10101_3: The grace of the Miracle is present even in those who are punished. Perhaps I might reduce the magnitude of this sentence by helping you.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10102_0: Bring me the quicksilver, which is capable of flourishing under our feet in any place at the whim of the Grievous One, and I will mix it with the bile from your flasks, thereby enhancing its gift.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10103_0: Graceful be the heart.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10104_0: With this silver, I bless the mixture that will recover your spilled blood.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10105_0: I feel tired... Please, leave me alone.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10106_0: The ancient one... is exiting my body... It is being born through the rift in my chest, from which its visage was peering.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10106_1: Penitent One... What must I do? Must I allow the Miracle to continue with its punishment?
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10106_2: Hurry. Bring me the quicksilver before it is too late.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10107_0: With this quicksilver, I bless the mixture... That will recover your spilled blood.
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10108_0: Hurry... Bring me the quicksilver before it is too late....
ST101_NACIMIENTO/DLG_10109_0: For your own sake, leave me alone... There is no need to think about what is about to happen...
ST101_NACIMIENTO/MSG_10101_0: The healing power of the Bile Flasks has been improved.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_0: The light... The light that you bring blinds my eyes...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_1: I am called Jibrael, held captive by the Ancient Miracle's plans since my arms grew, since the first creak of my crooked neck.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_2: The Miracle named me the messenger of the Saeta. Yes... The Saeta is the song, the genuine, pure melody... And very, very old...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_3: It has the power to make the roots of the Miracle unearth the hidden depths, what has already been forgotten, where the truly forbidden sleeps, that which awaits you...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10201_4: But we find ourselves in a mere abandoned chamber. After our encounter, the Miracle will take me where the Saeta will be able to resonate in all its grace.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10202_0: One Amanecida has already awoken, which is why the Saeta is already resounding.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_0: The same Grievous Will that allows you to see my bent and warped body is what has allowed you to enter the Gallery of the Five Dawns.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_1: This is where the sealed Mirror Sarcophagus is found, within which rests the body of Laudes, first of the Amanecidas. It was her very flesh that gave birth to the other four.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_2: No... A profane, distorted visage such as mine would never be reflected in such a holy casket, but yours would, still concealed behind the iron anonymity.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10203_3: Laudes waits. Though her body slumbers, her mind does not. She will open her eyes when the other four Amanecidas close theirs forever.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10204_0: Penitent One, the moment has arrived. It is your choice that I sound this bugle that weighs down my arms and twists my spine.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10204_1: It is your choice that its bronze exhumes the crystal tombs where the Amanecidas await you.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10205_0: You have prevailed in your first clash. The first Amanecida has closed her eyes and now rests elsewhere.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10206_0: The Amanecidas of the Miracle await you...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10207_0: Oh... I can wait...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10207_1: Yes... A little more...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10208_0: The time of the opening of the Mirror Sarcophagus draws near.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10209_0: The Miracle was jealous... Yes... It was jealous of that unmeasured passion towards the Twisted One of Laudes, and of her four replicas, her four reflections. It wanted all of that devotion for itself.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10209_1: Thus it took the Amanecidas and buried them deep in glass sarcophagi that contained all of that excessive fervour. It condemned them to wait until The Miracle reclaimed them freely.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10210_0: Laudes... Oh, my Laudes....
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10210_1: Have you been set free? Are you returning to the other side of the dream now that you have served your sentence?
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10210_2: Tell me that I will be at your side... Tell me that... all of this waiting... has not been in vain.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10211_0: The Amanecidas of the Miracle await you. Until then, Penitent One.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10213_0: Great happiness awaits me...
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_10214_0: The Ancient Miracle never forgot the Five... It bound them by its holy whim, it cursed them, it condemned them. Yes... It has kept them asleep in case it needed them. And now it needs them.
ST102_SANTOS/DLG_QT_10201_0: Do you want to make the bronze sing?
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1002_0: Let us be captives of the Miracle, Penitent One.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1003_0: Behold what I present to you; though a small piece, its great power should not be underestimated.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1003_1: Trust me, for I have the blood of kings on the palm of my hand.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1004_0: What I am offering you here is as lustrous as the first star of the night.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1004_1: And may my eyes be blinded if I am lying.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1005_0: This is a precious treasure to me... Its value goes far beyond what I ask for it.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1005_1: And may I don mourning black if I am trying to deceive you.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1006_0: Handing this over is not something that delights me, so its price is as high as its value to me.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1007_0: Feast your eyes on the envy of every merchant. The finest treasure to ever find its way into my hands.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1007_1: And may my heart stop beating if I am being dishonest.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_0: Do not be surprised to find this merchant here, this ancient occupation requires me to be wherever I can obtain rewarding benefits.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_1: Call me Candelaria, for what I sell would make your eyes light up like the high bonfires.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_2: I will not ask you for any money whatsoever; those forbidden tears you shed would be more than enough for me.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1010_3: Go ahead, cast your darkened eyes over these valuable treasures.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1012_0: Come back when you have more Tears of Atonement.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1013_0: And may the bells toll for me if I ever deceive you.
ST10_CANDELARIA/DLG_1014_0: And may the bells toll for me if I ever deceive you.
ST10_CANDELARIA/MSG_1001_0: The key has been broken.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1101_0: The sound does not cease.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1101_1: It creeps on these forgotten walls, and no one can determine its origin or its obscure destiny.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1101_2: For the love of the the High Wills, silence it, for I have long yearned for it.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_1106_0: For the love of the High Wills, make the sound cease.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_0: I, Diosdado by name, night watchman by trade, am at thy mercy.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_1: You have my gratitude for quelling such an unbearable sound.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_2: We are in the Library of the Denied Words, for the pages that lie within these dusty tomes are forbidden and forever shall be.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11201_3: All that accompanies me here are these ponderous keys and the wandering souls that, even after death, still hunger for knowledge.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11202_0: Watch your step as these halls can be deceptive.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11203_0: Oh, that key of yours that you are carrying...
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11203_1: It opens a door that was veiled in ancient illusions many aeons ago.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11204_0: Beware of what sleeps there.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11205_0: The door awaits thee.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11205_1: Be careful of what sleeps beyond.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11206_0: The Visage...
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11206_1: At times, during the most profound silences, you can hear the gold melting within the rock, within the very roots.
ST11_SERENO/DLG_11207_0: Watch your step, as these rooms can be deceptive.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_0: Penitent One in sleeplessness.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_1: Carrying the guilty sword, you have committed the most serious crimes against the Mother and her Saints, against the Miracle and its outbreaks.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_2: We have been entrusted with putting an end to your mission.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_3: I, Crisanta in penance, excommunicate you, expel you, execrate you, with the blessing of Our Miracle of the Greatest Pain.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1201_4: And thus shall your name be erased under the heavens.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1202_0: Go on... Purge my soul, bitten by The Miracle.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_1208_0: And thus...shall your name be erased under the heavens...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_0: Once again... My mask of blindness meets your silent one.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_1: Do not worry on my account... The crimson cords protect me from being wounded...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_2: It is true, and so...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_3: Your sword and you - Guilt and Penance in holy communion - only you both can put an end to this eternal cycle. To this eternal twilight with neither beginning nor end.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_4: Penitent One, there is something greater than the Mother Church, greater than the Miracle, greater than what I have protected with my life and my faith...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_5: It is that which controls the Miracle...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_6: I am speaking of the Supreme Trinity... The High Wills.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_7: They can be found on the other side of the Dream, on the path of the Eternal Processions.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12201_8: But only a soul in Supreme Suffering can obtain Supreme Absolution, and thus be able to reach such a place.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12202_0: Now you are marked by the Four Wounds. The final ascension awaits beyond the Throne. Beyond the Dream.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12202_1: Perform your final penance and make your way to the Turned Throne.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12202_2: The Eternal Processions await us on the other side.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_0: This pain... that I feel...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_1: It is... deeper... more ancient...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_2: The Guilt you carry... has broken something inside of me...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_3: My faith... My soul... is wounded...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_4: I will now walk to the chapel where it all began, where the first Kneeling took place.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_5: Your first step... towards atonement.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12203_6: Now leave me alone with my deep wound.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_0: The severed crimson bindings now reveal my agony.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_1: They are uneasy to see you, the architect of sacrilege, here at the end of this bitter, sombre and desolate path...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_2: His Holiness, our father, awaits you under the marble of his white deambulatory.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_3: He will achieve that which my bandaged sword could not. He will leave you on your knees in the ashes of the holy tree that once burned.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12204_4: He will lay his merciful hand on your forehead sanctifying the end of your blasphemy.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12205_0: Leave me alone with these lies, with the chimera, with the delirium of my own pain.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_0: That sword you wield...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_1: The High Wills sing that I must escape the kiss of its steel, as it is wholly tainted by the heresy of its bearer.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_2: The Great Ones, from the Eternal Processions, demand that I should battle until I draw my dying breath.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12206_3: The Three...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12207_0: The High Voices proclaim that your execution cannot be delayed.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12207_1: And so I fear... that my penance is far from over.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12208_0: Not while their voices still echo... Not while your silence endures...
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12209_0: The guardian has fallen.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12209_1: The final truth awaits you. The final outrage.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12209_2: Go forward now through the embroidered mantles towards the light.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12210_0: Behind me, Penitent One.
ST12_CRISANTA/DLG_12210_1: Take cover in my crimson bindings.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1401_0: The Deformity has opened up.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1401_1: You have been granted three knotted tongues, able to grow deep roots that will twist and wring, copying the pain of their three mothers.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1401_2: In the name of the High Wills, I bless this relic. Watch over it, for it is now pure and sacred.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1403_0: At the time of its death, before the journey, the Miracle kissed the hand of the master, stopping the corruption of the flesh and granting him a new grace.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1403_1: In the name of the High Wills, I bless this relic. Watch over it, for it is now pure and sacred.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1404_0: Behold the linen cloth that soaks the sweat of fevers, of thoughts, of dreamt sins.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1404_1: A tool that obtains secret and forbidden confessions, even from those who already departed to the other side of the Dream.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1404_2: In the name of the High Wills, I bless this relic. Watch over it, for it is now pure and sacred.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_0: This place is another dream, Penitent One.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_1: They believed me a saint worthy of devotions, and the only thing I granted to their prayers was the saltpetre that runs through this stark land and rises through our bodies. 
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_2: The punishment of the Miracle for the false idol is to grant them false holiness.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1406_3: Do not try to obtain my name, for it is also covered in salt.
ST14_LOTL/DLG_1410_0: Bring me anything that can be blessed, so you might crush this fate of mine and let me cross to the other side of this false dream.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1501_0: Penitent One without a name, find my brothers and guide them to me.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1502_0: Penitent One, in finding these holy brethren of mine you have completed the vision of my birth, which was painted on a sleeping canvas.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1502_1: My name being Jocinero, I was born of the moon and of the torment of a brave bull, and of myself, by the grace of High Wills, my holy brethren.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1503_0: Joyful are your returning steps. You have found all of my brothers imprisoned by the Miracle.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1503_1: Now that they are free they will be able to protect all souls in penance, as well as your own.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1503_2: Come closer, and take this piece of moon. With it, one of my holy brethren will join you whenever necessary.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1504_0: Contrite be the heart, Penitent One in good fortune.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1506_0: You have found some of my brothers.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1506_1: Though I still ask you to find the rest of them, please keep this canvas made from the gold of our faces, and the Brothers will guide you.
ST15_MOONCHILD/DLG_1507_0: Please find the rest.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1701_0: With this gold that melts between my fingers, I reject the riches of my betrothed. 
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1702_0: With this torn ribbon I reject this bond with my betrothed.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1703_0: With this veil I cover my face in mourning for the dead love for my betrothed.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1704_0: Penitent One in silence, who summons my three voices.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1704_1: Three sisters became as one, thus birthing a Grievous Miracle called Altasgracias.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1704_2: This egg conceals something of ours that still remains immaculate.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1705_0: Take it with you, and thus take its purity away from us, for it is already too late for these deformed bodies.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1706_0: Our rageful voices were banished then. Now the Miracle has made them eternal.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1706_1: Remember that only the Holiness can bless this gift so that it is without sin.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1706_2: Our voices can be protection on the pathways along which your fortunate steps will take you.
ST17_ALTASGRACIAS/DLG_1707_0: Leave now. Our deformities will depart to the other side of The Dream to find absolution.
ST18_NAZARIO/MSG_1801_0: The Virtue of Mea Culpa hath ascended.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_0: This lowly servant greets you, oh Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_1: Welcome to the ossuary of all those who will be eternally remembered.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_2: My duty is none other than to provide shelter to each and every one of these skeletal remains that linger under these intangible veils of dust.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_3: It matters little how many years or centuries have passed; the bones speak to us, through their creaking and grinding and through their silence.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_4: But these remains need one another in order to reveal the truth they still guard within.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_5: Only together, in intimate brotherhood, will they achieve eternal rest. For this, they beg that you help them.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20101_6: Bring them before me and in this way we will uncover the truth that they have silenced.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20102_0: Listen to the creaking of the bones in the darkness; for they hear us too.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20102_1: The bones are grateful for your help. They are awakening and with them, so too is the Voice.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20103_0: This great ossuary is filling up. The ashes flow ever more from the urns...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20104_0: The pale brotherhood of the bones is about to be completed.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20104_1: Do not falter now, Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_0: Oh... The ossuary is now complete.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_1: So, my mission here has ended.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_2: No... I will no longer watch over the bones...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_3: It is they who will now watch over me in this tomb of pale and merciful ash.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20105_4: May their peace be with you, Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20106_0: Bring the rest of the bones before me, Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_0: Can you already hear their song? Can you already hear their ancient aria?
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_1: The lady who sang to the bones has awoken...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_2: The skeletal remains on the other side have opened the door to you. They bid you welcome.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20107_3: But beware of the secret they wish to share.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_0: Penitent One, you have finished with the suffering of the Singer.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_1: Her song was formed by the very voices of all the souls resting in this place;
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_2: their stories, tragedies and sorrows flowed through her voice creating melodious echoes.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_3: Creating a psalm of shadows.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20108_4: The voice of the dead, Isidora...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20109_0: Look... see how the ash rises up beneath our feet.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20109_1: From the other side of the door, the bones long for the Voice to awaken and sing to us once more.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20109_2: Oh... her sweet Voice...
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20110_0: Bring the bones before me and we will uncover the truth that they keep silent.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20111_0: The bones thank you for your help, oh virtuous Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20112_0: The bones thank you for your help, oh virtuous Penitent One.
ST201_UNDERTAKER/DLG_20112_1: Bring the bones before me and we will uncover the truth that they keep silent.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20201_0: Penitent One, you stand before the tomb below which my name, Perpetva, rests. And with it, a body vanquished a long time ago.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20201_1: Although we were already introduced through the wounds of our confrontation, the audacity of your faith now gives us the chance to meet once again.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20201_2: A meeting behind the back of a Miracle that ends up knowing all.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20202_0: You fell before a deception, created by the Miraculous Zeal, that possessed my face and armour but not my voice, which is now free from sin and dominion.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20202_1: But I could see that your will is greater than any pain in your body and in your deaths, and that they will not hold you back in the journey ahead.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20203_0: You were able to defeat the lie created by the Miraculous Zeal that possessed my face and armour but not my voice, which is now free of sin and dominion.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20203_1: However, I see in you that the guilt that weighs so heavily in both your heart and hands is deserving of such arduous penance.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_0: Such is your strength that my brother Esdras, convinced that you will commit crimes against the Church, has asked for my blessing to prevent you accessing such a sacred place.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_1: Penitent One, I have seen a different path for you, whose ultimate destination is neither the forbidden nor the sacred places kept behind the high walls of Mother Church.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_2: Rise above all that, above even the halls of the Dream.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_3: This voice of mine is limited, it cannot disperse all the invisible mists that tangle up the truth and mislead us.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_4: You must meet with my brother. He will be waiting for you on the bridge that leads to the Door of the Holy Visages.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_5: Take this scapular, whose sheen will tell him you have my blessing, and before which he will surely fall to his knees. As he loves me, deeply.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20204_6: At that moment, my soft whisper will reach his ears, beseeching him to assist you.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_0: Penitent One, you have defeated my brother and now he is in a faraway place where my voice does not reach.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_1: I cannot ask him to help you unravel these shadows that keep weaving themselves before us, for they protect a truth that is now lost to us.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_2: Like you, the Miracle perpetuates its obscurity.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_3: Leave me now to watch over my brother even if seas, skies and red horizons separate us.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20205_4: Go, Penitent One.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20206_0: Go fearlessly, Penitent One.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20207_0: The wounds of our first confrontation healed long ago.
ST202_PERPETUA/DLG_20207_1: Even then I could see how unyielding you were in your purpose and that nothing would cause you to waver.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_0: Penitent One of the silent steps.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_10: Find my eyes, Penitent One. For only then will I be able to reveal my secret to you.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_1: Approach this face of pale gold, with empty sockets instead of eyes.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_2: You stand before the roots of the knotted tree of the Three Words, for these form the bars of my captivity.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_3: They claim that my words are false and that mine is the face of deception...
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_4: And for this reason, I have been exiled from my three other brothers, the Holy Guardian Visages.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_5: They betrayed me, punished me and ripped out my eyes, so I could no longer be a witness to the truth.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_6: Now there is only infinite darkness around me.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_7: May your compassion help you in the search for my stolen, golden eyes.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_8: One of them can be found in a place inhabited by bone, ash and song.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20301_9: The other can be found in a dried-up sea, to which ships head to die amidst the terrible thunder.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20302_0: Oh... Even in this place, beneath so many floors, I am bedazzled.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20302_1: But blessed be the light whose intensity blinds, for behind it lies always a seed of virtue.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20302_2: Find my other eye, oh merciful Penitent One.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_0: You have found my eyes...
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_1: Now I can see this terrible place, this prison of what I am and have been for so very long...
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_2: Penitent One, listen carefully.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_3: In the most fervent souls, in the most devout hearts lives the seed that lulls the consciousness and controls the will:
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_4: They are the links of invisible chains that hail from remote, sacred and forbidden places.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_5: From where the High Wills dwell.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_6: I am going to give you that which I have been protecting since I was banished from the Dream.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20303_7: Here, take it. This is the True Heart of your guilty blade.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20305_0: May your compassion help you find my stolen eyes.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20305_1: For only then will I be able to reveal my secret to you.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20306_0: Penitent One, find my other eye.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20306_1: For only then will I be able to reveal my secret to you.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20307_0: With this heart you will awaken the true guilt of your sword, enabling you to pierce the hearts shrouded by the Miracle's veil.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20308_0: Cast off the chains from the soul whose profession of faith, engraved on her helmet, is the truest, most righteous and unwavering of all.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20308_1: The soul of Crisanta of the Wrapped Agony.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20308_2: And in this way, you will inflict the greatest of all wounds upon her. The wound to the soul.
ST203_ABNEGATION/DLG_20308_3: The greatest... of all wounds...
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_0: Penitent One, who comes into our presence.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_10: Of this brotherhood of grieving souls, held captive by their own condemnation and benediction?
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_11: This is the Path of the Ancient Processions. The Kingdom that the Miracle wove from threads of dreams.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_12: A domain where faith would unite in one single, uninterrupted act of adoration.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_13: That would give us light and time.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_14: That would make us eternal.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_15: And higher-reaching than the sky itself.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_1: Bringing guilt to the most sacred of places, to the most forbidden of temples.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_2: Breaking all laws and thus desecrating his Holiness himself.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_3: We are the High Wills.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_4: For there is no miracle that does not stem from our desire.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_5: That is not our reflection.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_6: That is not our Word.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_7: The Word that was first made flesh and then sanctified.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_8: Penitent One, does not the pale, still light of this vast horizon hurt your eyes?
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20401_9: Of this procession, more ancient than us, that extends out before you without end nor beginning?
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_0: You have come to this place to atone for your sins, to put an end to this Work.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_1: Destroying our flesh that once was Word and now is but silence.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_2: Making us cast down our eyes, leaving the Miracle bereft.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_3: And so the last of our wills is your eternal condemnation.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_4: In life and in death, in hunger and in thirst, in sleep and in wakefulness.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_5: Buried under layers of ash, the ash of your flesh, bones and sinew.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_6: Execrated in visage. Forgotten in name. For ever and ever.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20402_7: There is no penance that can exonerate this Sin.
ST204_HIGH_WILLS/DLG_20403_0: It is the price to pay for the ultimate blasphemy.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_0: Faceless warrior, stay thy course.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_1: I sense... a heavy burden within thee, although I can neither see thy face, nor hear thy voice.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_2: Forgive my manners... My name is Miriam.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_3: This place of crimson shadows has summoned me.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_4: Something in this suffering land, a will that eludes my understanding, decided that I alter the course of my journey and brought me to this place.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_5: And if it has sanctioned this meeting, it must be because we are being put to the test, destined to mutually help one another under its watchful gaze.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_6: This crystal that lies before us is what allows me to travel to distant lands.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_7: But, as you can see, it is cracked and its magic extinguished.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_8: To restore it, I must find the shards that are scattered throughout your world.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20501_9: I beg you, allow me to show you one of them. It lies beyond this door.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20502_0: This is one of the Portals of the Blue Rose that guard each and every one of the crystal shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20502_1: The force of its magic will not allow me to enter.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20502_2: Pray, help me, anonymous warrior. Enter in my stead and retrieve the shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20502_3: I must return to my kingdom and I must not tarry.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20503_0: Look! The journeying Crystal is restoring itself.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20503_1: I feel its magic growing strong again.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20503_2: Pray, help me retrieve the remaining shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20504_0: Look, the Portal of the Blue Rose has closed...
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20504_1: The shard has returned and the Crystal is reforming.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20504_2: I beg thee, help me retrieve the remaining shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20505_0: The Crystal is complete. It has recovered all its power.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20505_1: I am ready to depart now. I must return to my land and leave you.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20505_2: I do not know if we will meet again, faceless warrior. But pray keep this as a symbol of my gratitude.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20506_0: With this prayer that I grant you, you can invoke a portion of my power.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20506_1: Use it wisely as ‘tis magic that descends from the very shadows.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20507_0: Help me, warrior. Enter the portals and retrieve the Crystal shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20508_0: I beseech thee, retrieve the remaining shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20509_0: The Crystal is reforming. I feel its magic, its call...
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20510_0: Warrior, you have retrieved all the shards.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20510_1: Let us return to the Hall of Mirrors.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20511_0: Let us return to where the Crystal lies.
ST205_MIRIAM/DLG_20512_0: Until we meet again, warrior.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2001_0: I have witnessed the exhumation of the Archbishop. I have witnessed how they cleansed his bones in wine to then dress him in silk and gold. I saw them place the most beautiful jewels on his face and kiss his forehead. I watched as they placed rings on his fingers and kissed his hands. They lifted him up, calling his name, and swayed him to make it look as if he was walking again.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2002_0: I can feel Our Lady between these walls. I can feel her warmth, for her face still burns, a reminder of her sacrifice and ours. The pain, the cold and the burn are our Rules.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2003_0: I am fearful. The little one stopped crying as soon as we placed him in the arms of that wicker woman, as if it were his mother. Sometimes I can't help but think there's something living in that wicker. Sometimes it seems to be rocking him in the darkness.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2004_0: Indeed, it is the Groan. It comes from the deepest core of this place, slithering in spirals, growing with its own echo, distorting amidst the bronze embossings. The cry of three intertwined throats born of a single penance, a single mourning. Light hardly ever reaches here, only the cold, and the Groan.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2005_0: I saw him approaching between the bars. I saw fire burst through his chest and scorch him. I saw fire burn again from thin air, and fuse his skin. He walks with fire, and fire with him.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2006_0: In dreams I hear him speak to me, even though his words have no sound. In dreams I can see him watch me, even though his eyes are made of silver.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2007_0: When I walk by the chapel of the Perpetual Agony, I can never bring myself to enter it. She still screams in pain like the very first day they brought her here. "A living miracle!" they said. The Miracle granted her wish and now we pray to her, watching her endless ordeal.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2008_0: What are those little ones that seem to hide up in the ceilings, amongst the ornaments of the altars? When I call them, they do not appear to pay me any mind. They are covered in ribbons that give the impression of fluttering in an invisible, imperceptible, constant wind... At times I hear them cry, and at times I hear them laugh. What are you, oh creatures of divine grace!?
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2009_0: I hear them reading. They mutter the forbidden writings. It is a constant murmuring whose echoes, once inside my mind, refuse to leave. I know that my curiosity will kill me, if my madness does not do it first.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2010_0: It is closer now. The crying faces of ice announce the proximity of the convent. They presage the pain awaiting inside its walls. I ask the cold to be merciful and allow me to climb to the peaks, where I will be reborn as a sister of golden visage.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2011_0: On this sacred floor I will be safe. They will hear neither my footsteps nor my fear. The Miracle wanted the oranges from those trees to make no sound on falling, so that only the wind through the columns and buttresses could be heard... Now I hear only the horrific screams of those punished by the Miracle. I will wait patiently.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2012_0: How many more prayers does the Great Censer want? When will it tire and stop swaying? When will we be able to stand again? Lower your head... Close your eyes... Pray... And do not get up.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2013_0: There is the metal tree, erected as guardian of the bridge. That tree, with its eroded bark, is the symbol of His Holiness's final communion with the Miracle. Facing this eternal dusk, I will wait until I depart towards the other side of the Dream.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2014_0: I feel myself weakening. I am sentenced to perish, abandoned in this forceful praying position. I can no longer hear the rest, only their rusted cages, swaying in the wind.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2015_0: It must be around here... The bell will not stop ringing. I hear its jingling even in my dreams. My hands are wounded from all the digging. it must be around here... Just one more wound... I hear it close by...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2016_0: I can bear it no longer. That sound... That ringing will follow me forever. No matter where I go. This is my sentence. It is time to cross towards the other side of this cursed dream.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2017_0: The moon is out tonight with a long tailed gown, and a bull stares at her between the rockrose and the shadows.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2018_0: It cannot be... I could have sworn the candle depicted in that painting was lit, and that the room gleamed... Could I be losing my mind?
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2019_0: "Videte Ne Quis Sciat"
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2020_0: Listen, my son, to the silence. It is an undulating silence, a silence where valleys and echoes slide, a silence that bows foreheads to the ground.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2021_0: On these cliffs, located at the foot of a snowy abyss, the roots of a secret await those who are patient...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2022_0: Up and down, up and down... worse than pain, and worse than cold is the squeaking, the incessant squeaking of that damned floor of rusty mechanisms.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2022_1: Why would anyone want to use it so much?
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2023_0: Banished to oblivion, and prey to these walls, are some of the most valuable forbidden works of art...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2024_0: The sisters humble themselves before two holy figures in their crypts. What secrets might they be keeping...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2024_1: Their eyes anticipate sacrifices, anticipate pain, anticipate blood...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2025_0: Half do not return...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2026_0: Everyone passes...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2027_0: Beneath the earth the paths are misleading. This is the lie that haunts these tunnels. The howl of the wind and the roar of the waves can be heard and yet, there is no wind or sea... Not even the blue flame atop the masts burns our hands...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2028_0: A sacred light stains the highest branches of the iron tree. Its brilliance penetrates its walls into the hall where she rests, shrouding my eyes in purple darkness.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2029_0: I hear footsteps up above me, beyond the roots. I hear irregular, raspy breathing from behind the rock. I hear the worms nearby, slithering towards me.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2030_0: The doors are deceiving me, they do not want me to go. The walls are the only ones that do not lie. Through the walls lies the way out of this place...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2031_0: The waters are tranquil and dark like the blackest of marble. My face is reflected in them as in a mirror of darkness, which prevents me from escaping its gaze...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2032_0: We must return. I saw the shadow, I saw the gold under the black waters. We must return, the sea trembles when she is close at hand.
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2033_0: I saw the lady, the penitent one of gold and brocade, the one with the helmet whose visor shades her eyes as she watches the accursed and slowly setting sun...
ST20_CORPSES/DLG_2034_0: May the Miracle protect the unprepared souls that dare challenge the voices of bone and skull, as She won't allow anyone to interrupt her song.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2101_0: Do not fear my body, through which so much lightness and darkness pass, nor my visage, which appears disfigured from behind these golden bars.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2101_1: Soledad by name, I was locked up on the orders of His Holiness in this cage that the Miracle then proceeded to decorate.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2101_2: The High Will has granted me the opportunity to help you while my body remains a blue flame.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2101_3: I will wait, sleeping, until you hand the knots over to me so that my hands of smoke may tie them, thus expanding the mysteries of your rosary.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2102_0: Return once you possess new rosary knots to thread.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2102_1: May your heart be free of sin.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2103_0: Now let my fingers tie a new mystery.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2104_0: The mysteries of your rosary are now complete.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2104_1: My task is complete, although my sins have now become unforgivable as a result.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2104_2: I do not know where I will go, but I am sure that it will not be to the other side of the Dream.
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2105_0: My body of blue flame is being extinguished...
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/DLG_2106_0: Do you have more knots for me, Penitent One?
ST21_JAILED_GHOST/MSG_2101_0: New Rosary Mystery available.

ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2501_1: Guardian of the Miracle, and of the Miracle banner, with great pain, I carry the emblem of the Father.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2501_2: I am the hands of bloodied skin, I am the eyes from which our Mother gazes.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2501_3: But nothing I know of you, apart from your cold, nameless visage.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2501_4: Apart from your callused and wounded hands. Apart from the mourning of your deaths.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2501_5: No. I know nothing of you, only the Miracle knows.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2502_0: You have shattered the mirror in which you saw me asleep.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2502_1: Now you see me awoken as the son of the True Miracle.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2503_0: Now, may your sword full of guilt, with mine of gold, collide.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2503_1: Let them hurt and march in procession.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2503_2: I curse you forever in name.
ST25_PONTIFF/DLG_2503_3: I bless you forever in death.
Sword/HE01_CAPTION: Smoking Heart of Incense
Sword/HE01_DESCRIPTION: Enhances the power and duration of Prayers, but also increases their cost by one Fervour bar.
Sword/HE01_LORE: The Works and Graces of the Sorrowful Miracle. First Verse.@@The great dry tree into which His Holiness was transformed by work and grace of the Miracle burned in a night of heavy storms. It burned for ninety days, and as it was consumed, it left an enormous pile of ashes that covered the cathedral's main ambulatory tower, leaving His Holiness' Turned Throne on the top. All those who were present, and all those who arrived and tried to climb to the summit, were swallowed by the ashes. And the cathedral fell silent.
Sword/HE02_CAPTION: Heart of the Virtuous Pain
Sword/HE02_DESCRIPTION: Sword core, blessed with defensive prayers. Can be inserted into Mea Culpa. Boosts the blocking stance, increasing its duration, but exposes The Penitent One longer to enemy attacks.
Sword/HE02_LORE: The Works and Graces of the Sorrowful Miracle. Second Verse.@@@@The wind blew strongly through the fractures of the cathedral that the Great Tree had originated, lifting the ash creating dense gray clouds, hiding the whole Mother Church and drowning her in a deep darkness of lead. The ground began to tremble. Then a terrible cry was heard from the depths of the mountain of ash. And that cry was joined by more and more. Guttural screams, animal roars, monsters, and one which was heard above all: the scream of an old man, which resounded gravely, as out of the throat of a giant.@
Sword/HE03_CAPTION: Heart of Saltpeter Blood
Sword/HE03_DESCRIPTION: Attack damage is increased when The Penitent One is close to death.
Sword/HE03_LORE: It wasn't long before he was beatified. The Miracle bestowed a gift upon that humble parish priest and confessor: the visions of all sin, future and past, of thought and deed, of every person who approached him. He did not need to hear our confessions, because he already knew them all. He knew the penance, he knew the sincerity of our repentance. He knew everything. There was no more intimacy between sins and sinners; we were all naked before him, and the Miracle. Such grace came to be feared. He asked us to cover his head with a thick burlap cloth, in order to try and stop his constant visions of sin, and begged us to take him far, far away....
Sword/HE04_CAPTION: Heart of Oils
Sword/HE04_DESCRIPTION: This Heart is anointed with oils that inflame the soul. Sacred fury increases the strength of those who wield the sword, while at the same time lowering their defence.
Sword/HE04_LORE: "Father, as it always is after a procession, the ground was filled with puddles of blood from our penitents, who harm themselves with every excruciating step. But as I prayed on the windowsill, watching the night reflected on that holy reddish line, I noticed that someone, a cloaked figure, had begun collecting that blood in a shiny, metallic container."@"That figure you speak of, my son, must be none other than the roaming gipsy, the merchant they call Candelaria: a sage to some, a witch to others."
Sword/HE05_CAPTION: Heart of Cerulean Incense
Sword/HE05_DESCRIPTION: Sword core that shines, surrounded by a clear blue mist emanating from small creases. Its scents mix with the smell of shed blood, increasing Fervour generation. Regretably, the mist affects purity, weakening attacks based on blood.
Sword/HE05_LORE: The Works and Graces of the Sorrowful Miracle. Third Verse@@All those who once were swallowed by the ashes emerged from it in great hordes: the Hordes of the Miracle, the Punished. With only faith in their minds and only rage in their guts. Willing to punish all those who had escaped from such a holy fate, from the will of the Miracle itself.
Sword/HE06_CAPTION: Heart of the Holy Purge
Sword/HE06_DESCRIPTION: Sword core, blessed with fervent prayers. Can be inserted into Mea Culpa. Increases the Tears of Atonement reaped, but prevents the use of Bile Flasks.
Sword/HE06_LORE: The Legend of Mea Culpa, the Sword of Guilt@@It is said that this stone statue covered with petals was once a young woman who, tormented by a deep feeling of guilt, struck her chest with the figure of Our Father, asking him to be punished. The Miracle manifested itself in the figure of the Father, emerging from her a wide and long edge, a great rooted sword, which pierced her guilty heart to later transform her body into stone. That sword was called Mea Culpa in allusion to the last words of the young woman.
Sword/HE07_CAPTION: Molten Heart of Boiling Blood
Sword/HE07_DESCRIPTION: Sword core, dry and slightly porous to the touch. It causes Mea Culpa to throb thirstily after every kill, transferring life force to its wearer, but reducing the amount of health recovered by Bile Vessels.
Sword/HE07_LORE: "The master metalsmith, never ceasing to emboss the silver, asked, casually:@"If I may ask, from whom would the blessed blood that will be perpetuated in this brooch be?"@The priest replied:@"It will be from someone who is to die soon, betrayed by his own, condemned by the very authorities he obeyed."@The master stopped, and raised his sights:@"It is you, is it not?"
Sword/HE101_CAPTION: Brilliant Heart of Dawn
Sword/HE101_DESCRIPTION: The Essence of Laudes, woven into solid gold. Glowing with the incandescent passion that centuries ago gave birth to the four Amanecidas. It increases the speed of whoever wears it after a dodge manoeuvre, but reduces their defence by half.
Sword/HE101_LORE: The mere thought of you tires my body; the vision of you fills my eyes with tears. What do you provoke in me, holy stranger? It is your sacrifice that guides all the love I profess to you. @My sin is to love, to love holiness, the sacredness that resides in you and in what you represent, which is in turn blessed and forbidden. This love weighs more and more heavily within me, and asks me to leave the confines of my breast. I can no longer hold it back, for it has a will of its own. Let my skin open. Let my golden passion come forth and make itself available to you.
Sword/HE10_CAPTION: Heart of the Single Tone
Sword/HE10_DESCRIPTION: Sword core, which resounds with an inscrutable ringing. Can be inserted into Mea Culpa. Makes its edge vibrate, causing its attacks to destroy certain immaterial projectiles, but reducing the elemental resistances of its wielder.
Sword/HE10_LORE: Watch them. Watch as they climb up the burning ash. Watch how they crawl like hungry beasts. The ash swallows them one by one, insatiable. Such is the faith that the Miracle stirs in them. It makes them climb towards the Turned Throne by promising them a communion that will, indeed, happen, but not in the way they expect. Soon, when all of them have been swallowed up, they will be reborn, filled with a faith that neither you nor I will ever get to comprehend.
Sword/HE11_CAPTION: Heart of the Unnamed Minstrel
Sword/HE11_DESCRIPTION: Sword core, forged amidst ballads of forbidden verses. Can be inserted into Mea Culpa. Reduces the duration of the parry, but eases the execution of a Righteous Riposte.
Sword/HE11_LORE: "Sing for me, cantaor, and may your song relieve my pain." Those were the words written on the tombstone. There lay the one who prayed by singing, creator of verses that one fateful day reached the wrong hearts. And even if we no longer hear his voice, and no one calls his name, his singing will remain with us forever. 
Sword/HE201_CAPTION: Apodictic Heart of Mea Culpa
Sword/HE201_DESCRIPTION: The true core of the guilty blade, hijacked before the very birth of the sword. It transforms the tool into a weapon that can challenge the intentions of the powers that created it, completing the blade forever. @It increases the sword’s strength, making it able to fulfil its true purpose.
Sword/HE201_LORE: Four was the number of the Father's greatest devotees. Four who witnessed the first miracle. Four who prayed before the young man who twisted and contorted as his joints took root in the towering tree. Four who heard the three words uttered by the Father just before his last breath. Four who admired how the knotted tree, from which liquid gold flowed, grew.@Four who were the witnesses to the first Miracle but only one of whom could see the Miracle itself. He saw its form, fate and origin: a divine trinity, the High Wills.
